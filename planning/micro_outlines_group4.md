# Micro Outlines — Group 4 (ch12–ch14)

Purpose: 6–8 beat, image-forward micro-outlines to guide drafting while staying within rails (time phrases, units, song quota, canon).

## ch12 — Fog Intercept
- Weather set: river fog lifts off the shallows by sundown; shutters checked; posts assigned at the mid‑ford and under the willow shadow.
- Quiet listening: ferrystone “voice” reads lower and blurred; no reeds answered; proverb countersign agreed before any move.
- Test of patience: faint reed call from the south; watchers hold courtesy and give no sign; count the breaths between hiss and push.
- Mis‑signal executed: a low, hooded lantern swung once, then stilled and doused (“lantern low, never still”) to tease the bad channel toward a harmless shoal.
- Skiff diverted: wake crosses into safe shallows; rope grates and slackens; distant two‑blast horn carries; dusk crows lift and scatter.
- Recovery: tar scrap and a small watertight pouch taken from a snag; contents not read aloud at the bank; chain‑of‑custody noted.
- Tokens and notes: split‑stick set; brief slate entry made (times, bar chosen, wind); “no answering unknown reeds” restated for the next watch.
- Exit: fog thins; they hold the ford without pursuit and plan a fire‑side review by harvest light.

## ch13 — The Deserter’s Tale
- Hearth at the blind: after harvest, late; stew on; wet gear steams; quiet rules set (hands shown, no names asked).
- Stranger approaches: a ragged man is seen; courtesy offered; Ranger stands easy but near; no boasting of weapons.
- Hospitality first: food and a place by the bank fire; man steadies; fear named without shaming.
- Partial confession: “buyers” and “new masters” hinted, not named; work described—knots on reeds, bright cairn stones, ferrystone nudged “to make the count”.
- Proof aligned: knot meanings confirmed; rough map fragment produced (or matched to pouch); wide‑nail boot sign noted; orders came “by coin,” not by oath.
- Mercy chosen: no taking or binding; a warning given; the man sent off before first light by a safe line; compact observed.
- Record kept: Maralda copies the fragment; Tolly logs times and phrases; copy sealed for the Mayor and Mathom‑house.
- Next step set: agree to formalise ferry rules and rota with the Bounders at Hay Gate by bells.

## ch14 — Bounders’ Compact
- Bell‑time assembly: Bounders, a Ranger, and the companions meet at Hay Gate to formalise lessons learned.
- Compact drafted (plain speech):
  - No answering unknown reeds; day escort for strangers who ask the ford.
  - Lantern low, never still; keep to ground light only.
  - Double watches at dawn and dusk while the river sits lower.
  - One token tale per day (brief, factual); name little, mark much.
  - No tampering with stones/cairns without joint action.
- Ferry rules posted: ferrystone check schedule; clear bars after freshet; net placement resolved (red herring closed) and logged.
- Rota and tokens: dawn/dusk dots chalked; fork‑crown willow token formalised; tight‑turn knot taught to Bounders.
- Copies made: compact scribed twice—Mayor and Mathom‑house; red‑thread marking; Tomberic bears a service copy toward Longbottom.
- Courtesy tested: a whistle tries a Bounder; the proverb countersign holds; no leakage to onlookers.
- Close: Ranger’s “keep the watches”; compact hung where a passerby sees only rules, not secrets.

### Triad Sanity Check (Group 4)
- Time anchors: ch12 by sundown; ch13 after harvest; ch14 by bells — all from `config.yml` and varied across scenes.
- Song quota: none present across the triad; prior songs remain in earlier chapters only.
- Units and diction: miles/leagues only (none invoked in outlines); UK spelling assumed; banned modern lexis avoided.
- Canon rails: Rangers present but thin; wolves remain across; no named powers; no Nazgûl/Sharkey; no pitched fights.
- Memory chain continuity: fog mis‑signal → pouch/tar → deserter’s confirmation/map fragment → compact codifies practice.
- Glossary impact: no new proper nouns required; anchors use descriptive phrases (mid‑ford; willow shadow; bank fire) not needing glossary entries.
- Protocol coherence: countersigns agreed earlier (ch09) are referenced; ch14 formalises with copies/rota without re‑inventing.
