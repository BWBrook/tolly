# Micro Outlines — Group 6 (ch18 + Epilogue)

Purpose: image‑forward beats for the quiet resolution and closing frame, preserving rails and evidence chain.

## ch18 — The Ford Holds
- Morning audit: ferrystone steady; twig at true run still set; no new cairns; cord returned to post by unknown hand.
- Courtesy rounds: Bounders and Rangers exchange brief notes; rota cleaned; token left ordinary (all watches as posted; loose loop retained).
- Warning south: Nathron drafts a plain sentence and dispatches copies with a rider; message is practical (shoal map set straight; signals dismantled; compact posted).
- Small test: a reed call comes faint and is ignored; a skiff moves by day with escort; no scrape heard.
- Community touch: ferryman oils oars; boy chalks “escort” and learns to tidy the board edges; Tomberic barters apples for tar dab for plank.
- Turning homeward: companions note tasks left (deliver copies; Mathom-house deposit; Mayor brief); they take the hedge path back toward the Hay Gate by sundown.
- Ledger close: Tolly writes a short line—“Ford holds; warnings sent south; watches keep.”
- Image close: willow leaves stir; river keeps the old road.

## ch19 — The Memory Kept (Epilogue)
- Michel Delving by bells: Mathom-house steps; ledger room cool; Mossfoot receives packet.
- Chain of custody: red‑threaded items logged—map copy, knot primer, tar scrap, cord; dates and hands recorded.
- Mayor brief: one plain sentence for the civic ledger; compact acknowledged as standing practice at Hay Gate and ford overlook.
- Recognition without fuss: ferryman’s name written in a margin; Bounders’ rota chalked into routine; no speeches.
- Quiet addition: child in square mentions the leaf‑banner once more; memory persists from Book 1.
- Tolly’s note: “There and back by hedge and stone” written small in his pocket book; promises kept.
- Closing image: museum light, cool and ordinary; outside, lanes bright; watchwords live on boards, not in mouths.

### Sanity Check (Group 6)
- Time anchors: ch18 by sundown; ch19 by bells.
- Songs: none (quota observed; last song was ch16).
- Units/diction: miles/leagues if needed; UK spellings; banned modern lexis avoided.
- Canon rails: local closure; warnings south implied, no named powers; scale remains humane.
- Memory chain: deposits logged at Mathom-house; compact institutionalised locally; ferrystone/restored guides persist.
- Glossary: no new proper nouns required.
