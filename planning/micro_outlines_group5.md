# Micro Outlines — Group 5 (ch15–ch17)

Purpose: 6–8 beat, image‑forward outlines to guide drafting while keeping to rails and the evidence chain.

## ch15 — Night of Small Courage
- Bell‑set: night watch at the Hay Gate, fog thinned; posts assigned; boy with chalk learns to listen.
- Countersign in use: faint reed call tries the hedge; Bounder answers only with the proverb “By bells” and keeps still; no tidy call‑and‑answer.
- Lantern craft: Tomberic hoods a lantern low to warn a cart off the verge; no light shown toward the ford.
- Probe near the lane: soft knock on wood from beyond the hedge; watch holds; a shape withdraws when no signal returns.
- Quiet test: a stranger asks for the ford; offered stew and told “by day”; courtesy steadies fear.
- Small courage: Tomberic takes a slow walk to the chalk board and back to make stillness look like strength; boy copies it.
- Token and ledger: tight‑turn knot refreshed; brief note logged; no pursuit, no boasts.
- Dawn edge: first light greys the hedge; watches hand over cleanly.

## ch16 — Dismantling the Lines
- Muster at first light: Rangers and Bounders meet at willow‑holt; quiet plan agreed (no shouting; no heroics).
- Ferrystone check: depth voice verified; sketches updated; joint decision recorded.
- Cairn line cleared: bright stones bagged; finger‑pressed caps noted; wrong bar mapped “before” then “after”.
- Tar and twine: old stake scraped clean; tar smear logged; any found cord collected, red‑threaded, and taken to post.
- Restore true guides: unobtrusive markers (small twig‑leans, brush cleared at right bar) reset per ferryman’s habit.
- Courtesy to river: no big moves; nothing theatrical; work reads “maintenance,” not victory.
- Token/rota: fork‑crown willow knot set to “all watches as posted”; rota reflects joint work window.
- Ledger lines: one sentence for Mayor; one for Mathom‑house; copies to Ranger note.

## ch17 — Keep the Watches
- Morning at posts: Hay Gate and ford overlook receive the copied compact; small corrections made where boards warp.
- Ranger message: courteous relayed note from south reads, “Keep the watches”; said to come by a grey pilgrim, unnamed.
- Spread the practice: second post adopts the same rules; ferryman taught tight‑turn knot; boy teaches another boy.
- Sign audit: no reeds answered; no new cairns; ferrystone steady; crows count and go.
- Bounder kindness: a traveller sent by day with company; ledger note made; no names taken.
- Close the loop: Tolly copies clean versions for Mayor and Mathom‑house with red thread; Tomberic carries service copies.
- Token: split stick reset to ordinary; no special knots; stillness preferred.
- Outlook: ordinary lanes resume with better sense; horizon kept.

### Triad Sanity Check (Group 5)
- Time anchors: ch15 by bells; ch16 at first light; ch17 after harvest — varied and in list.
- Song quota: none.
- Units/diction: miles/leagues only (not invoked directly); UK spellings; banned modern lexis avoided.
- Canon rails: local stakes; no Nazgûl/Sharkey; Rangers present but thin; no names for distant powers; no pitched fights.
- Memory chain: compact posted → probe stalls → false cairns removed → protocols propagate; ferrystone/ledger continuity preserved.
- Glossary: no new proper nouns required.
- Protocol coherence: countersign “By bells”; lantern low/never still; day escort; joint action for markers; token discipline maintained.
