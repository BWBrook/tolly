# TOLLY PRIMER — Series Bible + Next‑Novella Guide (Sarn Ford)

## 1) Character Dossier: Tolly (Tolman Noakes)

**Public facts (Shire‑visible)**

* Full name: Tolman Noakes; almost everyone calls him Tolly.
* Age: 28 in TA 3017 (SR 1417). Northfarthing farmhand; quiet, decent reputation.
* Guardianship: Raised by Auntie Wierdy after a childhood house‑fire; lives near the Greenfields.
* Associates: Maralda Bunce (Michel Delving archives), Tomberic Greenback (road‑savvy Hobbiton trader).

**Private spine (reader/agent only)**

* **Core want:** To “keep faith” by proving and preserving a buried shard of hobbit history. That personal vow (inherited from his father) powers his agency more than wanderlust.
* **Wound:** Fire trauma + a half‑conscious sense that memory can be lost as easily as a house. Night‑dreams of far voices and flames push him outward.
* **Ethos:** Courtesy first; courage second; glory never. When forced to choose, he picks mercy and accuracy over speed and spectacle.
* **Competence arc (3017):**

  * From anxious curiosity to field‑competent investigator.
  * Learns to read land and ruin by traveling to Michel Delving → Tower Hills → Annúminas/Evendim → Fornost; carries back **proof** (green‑fletched arrow shaft + leaf‑device banner‑scrap). 
  * Allies gained: **Glaeron** (Elf at Elostirion), **Nathron** (Ranger of the North), **Mossfoot** (Mathom-house), informal goodwill of the Mayor.

**Tells & motifs (reuse across books)**

* **Star + fire dyad:** Star = summons/true north; fire = loss/resolve.
* **Mathom‑logic:** Objects as memory keys (tinder‑box; arrowheads; banner scrap).
* **Thresholds:** Gates, hedges, bridges, **fords**. Scenes pivot on crossing them.
* **Speech:** Plain Shire idiom; understatements that harden into resolve when tested.

**Inventory continuity**

* Father’s battered tinder‑box; pouch of **ancient flint arrowheads** (Northfarthing trunk); personal notes; later: a careful copy of the **leaf‑device** scrap for safe reference (original deposited in Mathom-house).

## 2) Supporting Cast (possible returning characters)

* **Maralda Bunce** — archivist’s curiosity, practical, agile in ruins and records; moral compass toward evidence. 
* **Tomberic Greenback** — roadcraft, quick hands, brave under pressure; throws true. 
* **Auntie Wierdy** — hearth, skepticism, unconditional care; Shire‑reader’s anchor. 
* **Mossfoot (caretaker)** — gatekeeper of artifacts, legitimises public memory. 
* **Glaeron (Elf)** — courteous sentinel at the **White Towers**; gives direction, not solutions. 
* **Nathron (Ranger)** — watchfulness made human; moves plot with discreet aid; keeps the stakes credible. 

Use cameos sparingly, or introduce new characters. Either way, their job is to widen horizon, not steal agency.

---

## 3) World & Timeline Anchors (hard constraints)

* Date: **TA 3017 (SR 1417)**. The Shire is outwardly calm; **Rangers** quietly intensify the watch. No Nazgûl on Shire roads yet; **Sarn Ford** is still held by the Dúnedain. Sharkey/ruffians **not** in play. (Treat as atmospheric pressure, not plot devices.)
* Geography likely touched: **Tookland/Tuckborough → Southfarthing (Longbottom) → Brandywine/Baranduin** at **Sarn Ford** just outside the southern bounds. The Greenway is a rumor‑line more than a road you put feet on unless necessary.

---

## 4) What the last book established (canon for this series)

* The **hobbit archers** are no myth: material proof recovered at **Fornost**; **Annúminas** reconnoitred; **Elf/Ranger** corroboration; the Shire’s authorities (Mayor/Mathom-house) accept and preserve the relics. This recognition arc must **persist** in public memory in book 2.

## 5) The Next Novella — **Sarn Ford**: Writer’s Guide

**Premise (one line)**
Rumours of “strange goings‑on” near **Sarn Ford** draw Tolly south; what he finds is not a battle but a **border under strain**, where courtesy, patience, and clear seeing matter more than bravado.

**Thematic load**

* **Keeping watch vs. keeping faith**: the Rangers keep the ford; Tolly keeps the story.
* **Small acts as levees**: a warning given, a boat untied, a cache found — Shire‑scale eucatastrophes.
* **Threshold ethics**: who gets passage and why.

**Threat model (3017‑credible, no lore breaches)**

* **Human**: Southerners and vagrants probing the **Greenway/ford**; petty smugglers; a frightened deserter used as a catspaw.
* **Bestial**: Wolves, carrion crows in unnatural numbers; one tense night near the waterline.
* **Environmental**: Unseasonal fogs, odd river‑sign, cut‑marks on willows, footprints where no ferry should land.
* **Offstage powers**: only by inference (whispers of “new masters” south; never name Nazgûl; never conjure Sharkey).
* **Rangers** are present; they are not quest‑dispensers, and they’re fallible.

**Stakes**

* **Local**: Prevent a mapping/survey of Shire approaches; expose a signal system (stone cairns/river‑knots); avert a theft of stores at Longbottom; broker trust between **Bounders/Shirriffs** and the Rangers.
* **Personal**: Tolly tests whether he can act **before** proof exists, guided by judgment not relics.

**Register**

* Pastoral foreground (Southfarthing fields, pipe‑weed talk, fordworkers); measured‑epic horizon (Greenway, Rangers on the barrow‑brown ridge at dusk).

---

### 5.1 Cast & Roles (proposed)

* **Tolly** — lead; now steadier; writes notes, keeps maps; chooses mercy when it costs time.
* **Maralda** — returns as logistician/information‑wrangler; can read ferry ledgers and spot falsified hands; not a blade‑hand.
* **Tomberic** — road liaison; speaks with traders; handles cart/gear; the first to spot cut sign.
* **Ranger contact** — **Nathron** if you keep continuity; otherwise a new Dúnadan (same profile). They share limited intel and ask nothing foolish of hobbits.
* **Bounder/Shirriff** — local counterpart (name coinages: **Will Haybank**, **Hob Whitlow**). Their suspicion of Rangers can be a micro‑conflict.
* **Ambiguous stranger** — one southerner whose motives are mixed (fear > malice). Serves the **pity‑is‑strength** beat.

---

### 5.2 Geography & Movement (cheat‑sheet)

* **Route in**: Northfarthing → Michel Delving (brief) → Tuckborough → **Longbottom** → south lanes to the **Brandywine**.
* **The ford**: low water in late autumn, cobbled shallows; ruined way‑stones; ferry traces that “shouldn’t be here.”
* **Edges**: willow‑stands; marshy flats; a Ranger’s hidden fire‑site up on a gravel bluff; a Bounder post at the last stile.

Sprinkle **named** micro‑toponyms every 2–3 pages (e.g., **Sarn‑Shallows**, **Willowrigg**, **Haywarden’s Stile**). Keep etymology glossable.

---

### 5.3 Plot Architecture (Shire‑scale investigation)

1. **Quiet call** — Rumour‑seed: a Longbottom ledger shows unexplained after‑hours ferry scratches; a farm child found a knotted string in river‑reeds. Tolly hesitates, then goes.
2. **Threshold** — First look at the ford; courteous parley with a **Ranger** who will neither confirm nor deny details; a soft omen: stacked pebbles on a stump, not Shire‑work.
3. **False trail** — A “ruffian” turns out to be a hungry carter; the real signal is a chipped **grey stone** placed at ford‑poles to mark depths for night‑crossers.
4. **Complication** — **Bounders** and **Rangers** misread each other; Tolly plays interpreter, nearly spoiling both sides’ patience.
5. **Reveal (small scale)** — Night‑fog on the Brandywine; a skiff glides; Tomberic’s thrown stone disrupts a clandestine cache drop; the skiff flees.
6. **Moral hinge** — They corner a young southerner on the bank; Tolly **chooses mercy**, buys information with food and safe passage **away** from the Shire.
7. **Resolution** — Cache is lifted: a **crudely drawn map** of approach lanes, a **black‑dyed cord** with knot‑codes, a brass token from down‑Greenway. Tolly yields it to the Ranger—but makes meticulous copies for the **Mathom-house**.
8. **Return with addition** — Bounder‑Ranger truce warmed by shared tea; Shire lanes adjusted; ledger practice tightened. Tolly brings back **applied** memory, not just relics.

**Eucatastrophe (novella‑scale)**

* Nobody famous saved; instead, a mapped raid or spy network is **quietly averted** because one hobbit noticed the wrong cord on the right willow.

---

### 5.4 Scene Seeds (fill as needed)

* Ledger scene in **Longbottom**: Maralda spots a hand that writes south‑run letters oddly.
* **Ford at dusk**: gulls inland, odd in season; river smells “sea‑cold.”
* **Ranger blind**: a dry gully where driftwood is stacked with intent; Nathron teaches reading of **boot sign vs. Bounder foot**.
* **Fog‑intercept**: Tomberic, crouched in cold reeds, uses a **lantern shutter** to mis‑signal the skiff; it veers into shallows.
* **Hospitality test**: Tolly shares stew with the southerner; extracts knot‑code meaning without bullying.

---

### 5.5 Tone, Diction, Cadence — Sarn Ford Variant

* **Lexical palette** adds: ford, shoal, riffle, slackwater, willow‑holt, gravel‑bar, oar‑scars, ferrystone, jetty‑post, cress, wattle‑hurdle.
* **Weather** is a player: river‑mist; east wind at sundown; frost at dawn on shallows.
* **Songs**: one hobbit walking‑song with river words; one **Ranger** half‑lay heard at a distance (do **not** fully “translate”).

---

### 5.6 Safety & Canon Edges (do not cross)

* **No Nazgûl.**
* **No Sharkey/ruffians;** no Shire occupation.
* **Rangers hold Sarn Ford** (they are stretched thin, not absent).
* **Saruman** never named; “southerners” and “new masters” suffice.
* If Elves appear at all, it’s a **memory** or reported sighting near the Tower Hills, not at the ford.

---

## 6) Continuity Contracts from Book 1 → Book 2

* Tolly practices **evidence discipline** learned in the ruins: sketches, copies, chain‑of‑custody. He deposits **copies** with Mossfoot; originals he returns to the Rangers when appropriate. 
* Public memory **persists**: townsfolk in Michel Delving now speak (half‑proudly) of “our archers of old.” A child at Longbottom mentions the **leaf‑banner** in the Mathom-house. 
* Returning allies act **in‑character**: Glaeron remains a sentinel, not a travel guide; Nathron aids briefly and vanishes to other watches. 

---

## 7) Checks & Rubric Addendum (Sarn Ford)

**Hard gates (add to your lints):**

* **Place/river anchor** every ≤ 2 pp (ford name, willow‑holt, gravel‑bar).
* **No modern units/slang;** miles/leagues only; time by bells/sun.
* **Archaism budget** ≤ 6/1,000 words; Anglo\:Latinate ≈ 3:1 (Shire scenes), 2:1 (Ranger register).
* **Canon bans** respected (see §5.6).
* **Songs** ≤ 1/chapter; must move tone or memory.
* **Gloss proximity**: any new toponym glossed within 3 paragraphs.

**Soft targets:**

* **Polysyndeton** present \~1/400w; gentle alliteration \~1/paragraph.
* **Sentence‑length band**: 8–28 words, ≤ 2 long lines (35–45w) per 1,000w.
* **Eucatastrophe** present and Shire‑scale, not cinematic.

---

## 8) Reusable Micro‑moves (Sarn Ford)

* **Openings:** weather + water + task.

  * *Mist drew a line across the Brandywine, and Tolly watched it take the ford stone by stone while the Bounder counted the posts.*
* **Transitions:** river verbs and hedgerow geometry.

  * *They breasted the rise, and the ford lay patterned in the shallows like a checkerboard of old stones.*
* **Lore‑insert discipline:** one crisp sentence + image, never a lecture.

  * *Rangers, he was told, walked the ford by night with a pole cut to their shoulder—measuring the river as if it were a skittish beast, not water at all.*

---

## 9) Deliverables for the Repo

* `/background/tolly.md` — this dossier.
* `/background/ford_notes.md` — geography, knots/cairns codebook, ledger hand‑samples (synthetic).
* `/planning/outline_sarn_ford.md` — beats 1–8 (above) with scene bullets.
* `/planning/cast.tsv` — names, functions, first appearance.
* `/style/LEXICON/river.txt` — added diction list.
* `/checks/style_lint_spec.md` — extend with Sarn‑Ford anchors + canon bans (Nazgûl/Sharkey).
* `/chapters/` — ch01–ch07, 2.5–3k words each; one song only.

---

## 10) One‑page recap of Book 1

* **Inciting hunger:** dreams + father’s arrowheads move Tolly from Northfarthing to **Michel Delving**.
* **Team forms:** Maralda (archives), Tomberic (roads).
* **Evidence chain:** Mathom-house scraps → Northfarthing trunk finds → Brammek’s tale points west → **Elostirion** (Elf) → **Annúminas** (first confirmation) → **Fornost** (relics).
* **Return & recognition:** relics lodged; Mayor and Mathom-house validate; Shire memory shifts from rumor to record. 

---

### Closing counsel

Keep the **scale humane**. Sarn Ford in 3017 is not a battlefield; it is a **barometer**. Let your pages smell of wet willow and old stones. Let Tolly’s victory be the sort that makes no song today but prevents a worse song tomorrow. Keep the proof tidy, the mercy costly, and the Shire’s peace a thing worth thinking about—not merely having.
