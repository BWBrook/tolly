# Structural Plan — “Sarn Ford” Novella (TA 3017 / SR 1417)

Target: ~30,000 words. Bookends + 18 chapters (avg ~1,500 ± 500). Harness, not straight‑jacket. Arcs align to mind_map and WORKFLOW.

## Arc Overview
- A (Tolly): curiosity → field‑competent investigator → keeper of a memory chain (notes, knot primer, tar scrap, tally‑marks) → returns with protocols and proof.
- B (Trust): Bounders/Shirriffs ↔ Rangers move from wary coexistence to quiet coordination (countersigns, shared signals, watch schedule at the ford).
- C (Pressure): offstage Greenway unrest; Isengard‑leaning buyers; wolf‑sign south of bounds; crows muster; tension grows without breaching Shire lanes.

## Act Shape
- I. Shire calm, odd signs, decision to go.
- IIa. Learn river‑sign; false leads; rumor of Greenway waylayings; first near‑miss.
- Midpoint. Proof of mapping intent (knot code + cairn line + tally‑marks).
- IIb. Cover operation (store theft attempt) + fog intercept + wolf‑sign time pressure.
- III. Dismantle signals; formalize courtesy protocols; deliver warning; deposit records.

## Continuity & Canon Rails (summary)
- No Nazgûl or Sharkey events; no pitched battles; warg/wolf remain off Shire lanes; Saruman never named; Gandalf only as rumor or distant sighting passed via Ranger.
- Distances in miles/leagues; time anchors from config; ≤1 song per chapter; place/road anchors every ~700w.

## Next Actions (per WORKFLOW)
1) Stage 0–1: For each chapter, add brief + anchors to `chapters/_index.md`; pre‑create stubs only when beats are stable.
2) Stage 2: Ensure front matter in `ch01–ch02` matches this plan; prep `ch03` scaffold later.
3) Stage 3: Use `checks/run_style_checks.sh` to validate scaffolds.
4) Stage 4: Open a “Scaffold Batch 1 (ch03–ch06)” PR with review checklist before prose drafting.
