# Triad Tracking Log — Sarn Ford (TA 3017 / SR 1417)

Purpose: ultra‑lean continuity ledger. Update after each triad (every three chapters). Capture events, objects, protocols, and open threads without narrative bulk.

## Group 0 — Prologue to ch02

- ch00 — The Quiet Ledger (Michel Delving; by bells)
  - Events: Maralda notes foreign tally‑marks on leaf bales; prepares note to Tolly.
  - Objects: Buyer’s Seal (broad‑hand wax; black‑and‑green twine).
  - Signals: Crow‑mustering at dusk reported; Greenway tidings via carrier.
  - Open threads: Who are the buyers? why the tally? increased crows.

- ch01 — Mist on the Water (Bywater Road; The Water; after harvest)
  - Events: Reed‑whistle (three short) and soft knock on wood at pool; Tolly meets Tomberic; resolves to visit Michel Delving.
  - Objects: Short length of black‑and‑green twine recovered.
  - Signals/notes: Tolly begins pocket notes; Haygate Stone mentioned (local boundary marker).
  - Open threads: Source of reed call; link between twine and Buyer’s Seal.

- ch02 — Lanterns at the Hay Gate (Stock Road; Hay Gate; by sundown)
  - Events: Meeting with Bounders and Ranger Nathron; protocols agreed (no answering unknown signals; lantern shading; daytime escort policy).
  - Objects: Ranger shows sample cords (plain; black‑and‑green); watch rota begun on paper.
  - Signals/places: Token drop points (fork‑crown willow; notched rail at hollow lane); ferrystone concept introduced; distant two‑blast horn heard.
  - Song: hobbit watch song (AABB; lantern/river words), softly sung while trimming a wick.
  - Open threads: False cairns; ferrystone tamper; Greenway waylayings; rumour of a grey pilgrim; wolf‑sign south of bounds.

- chNN — Template Scaffold (front matter only)
  - Placeholder for future chapter entries until replaced by real chapters.

## Continuity Notes
- Memory chain: Buyer’s Seal → twine → knot code (to come) → cairn line (to come) → tar scrap (to come) → depth notes (to come).
- Courtesy/coordination: Bounders ↔ Rangers protocols established; use same phrasing going forward (no answering calls; hooded lantern low; daytime escort).
- Register cadence: ch00 (lore), ch01 (hearth), ch02 (road). Maintain gradual lift toward encounter across triads.

## Pending For Next Triad (ch03–ch05)
- Confirm ledger hand at Longbottom; witness bale transfer discreetly.
- First watch at Sarn Ford; gather initial river‑sign evidence; near‑miss skiff wake.
- Begin decoding reed‑knots; check ferrystone alignment.

## Group 1 — ch03 to ch05 (review)

- ch03 — Leaf and Ledger (Longbottom; leaf barns; by bells)
  - Events: ledger shows clerk‑copied foreign seal notes; steward confirms “buyer’s string”; smooth‑talker asked about bells/ferries; note posted for workers.
  - Objects: copied tally‑marks (to Mathom‑house); coloured twine match; tar crumb on old gate‑prop; boot print with wide nails.
  - Open threads: Who carries the mark south; path from barns toward ferry watchers.

- ch04 — Road Through Green Hills (Green Hill Country; Tookland; after harvest)
  - Events: companions align aims; walking song eases pace; farmer mentions black‑and‑green thread in hedge; hospitality in Tookland outskirts.
  - Objects: minor thread in hedge noted (left in place); aims recorded (learn, courtesy, record). Song (AABB) polished for cadence.
  - Open threads: crows’ patterns at dusk; small signs along hedges.

- ch05 — First Watch at the Ford (Sarn Ford; Ranger blind; at first light)
  - Events: Nathron teaches river‑reading; near‑miss skiff wake counted; no answers to taps; ferrystone voice logged; token placed at fork‑crown willow.
  - Objects: rope fibre from oar‑scar; tar scent; foam‑track timings; sketch of bars.
  - Open threads: false cairn pebbles too bright; reed‑knot decoding next; watch repeats by dawn.

Continuity: memory chain advances (tallies → twine → tar crumb → rope fibre + timings). Courtesy protocols upheld (no answers; low lanterns; one tale per day).

## Group 2 — ch06 to ch08 (review)

- ch06 — False Cairns (willow‑holt; gravel bar; by sundown)
  - Events: line of too‑bright cairn stones noted; second tiny cairn new‑set with finger‑press; fresh tar smear on low stake; torn scrap of tarred/waxed cloth recovered; positions sketched; no stones moved (courtesy upheld).
  - Objects: tarred cloth scrap (bagged); cairn map with hours; bearings vs. ferrystone/reef points.
  - Open threads: whether cairn line persists/propagates; who sets and resets; coordinate with Rangers before any removal.

- ch07 — Knots on the Reeds (reed beds; ferrystone; at first light)
  - Events: reed‑knot primer inferred (single=attention; double=bells; loop loose=wait; loop tight=go; tail‑tuck=choose left), marked “uncertain” where guessy; ferrystone voice constant; bundles moved/retied by unseen hand; footprint with wide nails logged.
  - Objects: knot diagrams + spacing; river‑condition context; amended ferrystone sketch.
  - Open threads: who ties; where timing points sit; test primer against later signals.

- ch08 — Wolf‑Sign at Dawn (south bank; shoals; at first light)
  - Events: wolf prints across the ford (one larger/deeper toe); old kill‑sign on south bank; distant Ranger lay fragment overheard; token set to double watches at dawn/dusk; “wait on the look” loop left.
  - Objects: none taken; descriptions and verse fragment noted.
  - Open threads: keep wolf/warg strictly off Shire lanes; maintain doubled watches while water sits lower; continue to ignore unknown reeds.

Continuity Check
- Memory chain: tallies → twine → tar crumb → rope fibre/tar → cairn map → knot primer + timing notes → wolf‑sign/time‑pressure.
- Protocols: no answering taps; low lanterns; one token tale/day; no tampering without coordination; doubled watches at dawn/dusk after ch08.
- Canon rails: no crossings into Shire lanes; wolves remain across; Ranger lay fragment kept distant and untranslated.

## Group 3 — ch09 to ch11 (review)

- ch09 — Countersigns and Courtesy (Hay Gate; Bounder post; by bells)
  - Events: young Bounder checked by “By bells”; Shire‑style countersigns agreed (proverbs, not passwords); rota chalked with dawn/dusk dots; polite stranger deflected by courtesy; split‑stick token adjusted.
  - Objects: four‑line courtesy list (By bells; Lantern low, never still; One tale per day; Name little, mark much); rota copy; Mathom‑house red‑threaded notice.
  - Notes: avoids tidy call‑and‑answer; uses natural phrasing; no leakage to onlookers.

- ch10 — The Tally and the Map (Longbottom; ford overlook; by sundown)
  - Events: proofs coalesce (knots + cairns + tallies + tar/fibre); dry Mathom‑house sentence written; Ranger brings Greenway tidings (waylaying kept quiet); packet dispatched to Mayor.
  - Objects: integrated evidence page; copies for barn/Mayor/Mathom‑house.
  - Notes: names withheld; emphasis on courtesy over “signals”.

- ch11 — The Moved Stone (ferrystone; shoals; at first light)
  - Events: ferrystone voice roughened with west wind; soft tongue found; near‑miss scrape/rope strain felt; new tar smear + fibre collected; decision to coordinate before moving stones; tokens set (double watches + wait on the look).
  - Objects: tracing of post scar; timing notes; fibre bagged.
  - Notes: maintains no‑tamper policy until joint action (later ch16).

Continuity & Rails
- Memory chain: tallies → twine → tar crumb → knot primer/cairn map → rope fibre/tar + near‑miss → integrated statement.
- Protocols: By bells; lantern low/never still; one token tale/day; no answers to unknown reeds; doubled watches; coordinate before moving markers.
- Canon: wolves remain across; no named powers invoked; Ranger lay fragment kept distant and functional.

  - Events (planned): fog rolls; lantern mis‑signal diverts a skiff to harmless shallows; tar scrap + watertight pouch recovered; faint two‑blast horn south; crows scatter.
  - Objects: pouch contents (to log later without spoilers); tar scrap; incident timings.
  - Open threads: test courtesy vs. cunning; keep tokens short; no pursuit.

- ch13 — The Deserter’s Tale (Anchors: bank fire; Ranger blind | Time: after harvest | Song: none)
  - Events (planned): hospitality test; frightened man confirms buyers/“new masters” without names; knot meanings confirmed and maps hinted; mercy shown.
  - Objects: rough map fragment; primer corroboration; no names recorded.
  - Open threads: signal origins; maintain rails (no overt naming).

- ch14 — Bounders’ Compact (Anchors: Hay Gate; watch posts | Time: by bells | Song: none)
  - Events (planned): formalise protocols; share countersigns; agree ferry rules; resolve missing net red herring.
  - Objects: posted rules copy; rota updates; Mathom‑house notice.
  - Open threads: readiness for later joint action (stone/cairn removal in ch16).
