# Triad Tracking Log — Sarn Ford (TA 3017 / SR 1417)

Purpose: ultra‑lean continuity ledger. Update after each triad (every three chapters). Capture events, objects, protocols, and open threads without narrative bulk.

## Group 0 — Prologue to ch02

- ch00 — The Quiet Ledger (Michel Delving; by bells)
  - Events: Maralda notes foreign tally‑marks on leaf bales; prepares note to Tolly.
  - Objects: Buyer’s Seal (broad‑hand wax; black‑and‑green twine).
  - Signals: Crow‑mustering at dusk reported; Greenway tidings via carrier.
  - Open threads: Who are the buyers? why the tally? increased crows.

- ch01 — Mist on the Water (Bywater Road; The Water; after harvest)
  - Events: Reed‑whistle (three short) and soft knock on wood at pool; Tolly meets Tomberic; resolves to visit Michel Delving.
  - Objects: Short length of black‑and‑green twine recovered.
  - Signals/notes: Tolly begins pocket notes; Haygate Stone mentioned (local boundary marker).
  - Open threads: Source of reed call; link between twine and Buyer’s Seal.

- ch02 — Lanterns at the Hay Gate (Stock Road; Hay Gate; by sundown)
  - Events: Meeting with Bounders and Ranger Nathron; protocols agreed (no answering unknown signals; lantern shading; daytime escort policy).
  - Objects: Ranger shows sample cords (plain; black‑and‑green); watch rota begun on paper.
  - Signals/places: Token drop points (fork‑crown willow; notched rail at hollow lane); ferrystone concept introduced; distant two‑blast horn heard.
  - Song: hobbit watch song (AABB; lantern/river words), softly sung while trimming a wick.
  - Open threads: False cairns; ferrystone tamper; Greenway waylayings; rumour of a grey pilgrim; wolf‑sign south of bounds.

- chNN — Template Scaffold (front matter only)
  - Placeholder for future chapter entries until replaced by real chapters.

## Continuity Notes
- Memory chain: Buyer’s Seal → twine → knot code (to come) → cairn line (to come) → tar scrap (to come) → depth notes (to come).
- Courtesy/coordination: Bounders ↔ Rangers protocols established; use same phrasing going forward (no answering calls; hooded lantern low; daytime escort).
- Register cadence: ch00 (lore), ch01 (hearth), ch02 (road). Maintain gradual lift toward encounter across triads.

## Pending For Next Triad (ch03–ch05)
- Confirm ledger hand at Longbottom; witness bale transfer discreetly.
- First watch at Sarn Ford; gather initial river‑sign evidence; near‑miss skiff wake.
- Begin decoding reed‑knots; check ferrystone alignment.
