# Triad Tracking Log — Sarn Ford (TA 3017 / SR 1417)

Purpose: ultra‑lean continuity ledger. Update after each triad (every three chapters). Capture events, objects, protocols, and open threads without narrative bulk.

## Group 0 — Prologue to ch02

- ch00 — The Quiet Ledger (Michel Delving; by bells)
  - Events: Maralda notes foreign tally‑marks on leaf bales; prepares note to Tolly.
  - Objects: Buyer’s Seal (broad‑hand wax; black‑and‑green twine).
  - Signals: Crow‑mustering at dusk reported; Greenway tidings via carrier.
  - Open threads: Who are the buyers? why the tally? increased crows.

- ch01 — Mist on the Water (Bywater Road; The Water; after harvest)
  - Events: Reed‑whistle (three short) and soft knock on wood at pool; Tolly meets Tomberic; resolves to visit Michel Delving.
  - Objects: Short length of black‑and‑green twine recovered.
  - Signals/notes: Tolly begins pocket notes; Haygate Stone mentioned (local boundary marker).
  - Open threads: Source of reed call; link between twine and Buyer’s Seal.

- ch02 — Lanterns at the Hay Gate (Stock Road; Hay Gate; by sundown)
  - Events: Meeting with Bounders and Ranger Nathron; protocols agreed (no answering unknown signals; lantern shading; daytime escort policy).
  - Objects: Ranger shows sample cords (plain; black‑and‑green); watch rota begun on paper.
  - Signals/places: Token drop points (fork‑crown willow; notched rail at hollow lane); ferrystone concept introduced; distant two‑blast horn heard.
  - Song: hobbit watch song (AABB; lantern/river words), softly sung while trimming a wick.
  - Open threads: False cairns; ferrystone tamper; Greenway waylayings; rumour of a grey pilgrim; wolf‑sign south of bounds.

- chNN — Template Scaffold (front matter only)
  - Placeholder for future chapter entries until replaced by real chapters.

## Continuity Notes
- Memory chain: Buyer’s Seal → twine → knot code (to come) → cairn line (to come) → tar scrap (to come) → depth notes (to come).
- Courtesy/coordination: Bounders ↔ Rangers protocols established; use same phrasing going forward (no answering calls; hooded lantern low; daytime escort).
- Register cadence: ch00 (lore), ch01 (hearth), ch02 (road). Maintain gradual lift toward encounter across triads.

## Pending For Next Triad (ch03–ch05)
- Confirm ledger hand at Longbottom; witness bale transfer discreetly.
- First watch at Sarn Ford; gather initial river‑sign evidence; near‑miss skiff wake.
- Begin decoding reed‑knots; check ferrystone alignment.

## Group 1 — ch03 to ch05 (review)

- ch03 — Leaf and Ledger (Longbottom; leaf barns; by bells)
  - Events: ledger shows clerk‑copied foreign seal notes; steward confirms “buyer’s string”; smooth‑talker asked about bells/ferries; note posted for workers.
  - Objects: copied tally‑marks (to Mathom‑house); coloured twine match; tar crumb on old gate‑prop; boot print with wide nails.
  - Open threads: Who carries the mark south; path from barns toward ferry watchers.

- ch04 — Road Through Green Hills (Green Hill Country; Tookland; after harvest)
  - Events: companions align aims; walking song eases pace; farmer mentions black‑and‑green thread in hedge; hospitality in Tookland outskirts.
  - Objects: minor thread in hedge noted (left in place); aims recorded (learn, courtesy, record). Song (AABB) polished for cadence.
  - Open threads: crows’ patterns at dusk; small signs along hedges.

- ch05 — First Watch at the Ford (Sarn Ford; Ranger blind; at first light)
  - Events: Nathron teaches river‑reading; near‑miss skiff wake counted; no answers to taps; ferrystone voice logged; token placed at fork‑crown willow.
  - Objects: rope fibre from oar‑scar; tar scent; foam‑track timings; sketch of bars.
  - Open threads: false cairn pebbles too bright; reed‑knot decoding next; watch repeats by dawn.

Continuity: memory chain advances (tallies → twine → tar crumb → rope fibre + timings). Courtesy protocols upheld (no answers; low lanterns; one tale per day).
