# Novella Mind Map — “Sarn Ford” (TA 3017 / SR 1417)

Center premise: strange goings‑on near Sarn Ford; a Shire hobbit (Tolly) keeps faith with memory while Rangers keep the ford. Tone: pastoral foreground, epic horizon. Scale: human‑sized; no grand battles.

## Cast & Factions (spokes)
- Core: Tolly [full name: Tolman Noakes] (quiet, evidence‑minded); Maralda Bunce (archives, practical); Tomberic Greenback (roadcraft, brave).
- Shire: Auntie Wierdy (hearth), Bounders/Shirriffs (gatekeeping, etiquette), Michel Delving officials (Mathom-house).
- Rangers: Nathron + 1–2 unnamed; courteous, wary; not quest‑dispensers.
- Riverfolk: ferryman, weed‑cutters, night watch.
- Southerners/Vagrants: mixed motives; one frightened deserter used by others.
- Romance: understated, slow-burn development of the personal relationship between Tolly and Maralda; very Tolkienesque.

## Places & Thresholds (edges to cross)
- Shire lanes: Bywater Road, Stock Road, Green Hill Country, Hay Gate.
- Border: Sarn Ford (gravel bars, ferrystone), willow‑holt landings, Ranger blind.
- Waypoints: Longbottom (leaf barns), Brandywine bank, Buckland hedge vicinity (seen from Shire side only).

## Pressures & Threat Model (allowed in 3017)
- Human: survey/mapping of Shire approaches; smuggling probe; decoy cairns; Isengard‑leaning buyers using cut‑outs to barter for Southfarthing leaf; Greenway waylayings (reported via Bree/Rangers, not on Shire roads).
- Bestial: wolf pack ranging south of the bounds; signs of a warg among them (prints, kill‑pattern, distant howls); never a pitched fight inside the Shire.
- Environmental: unseasonal fogs, cut‑marks on willows, odd river‑sign.

## Mystery Threads (braidable)
- Signal system: river‑knots on reeds/cord; lantern shutters; cairn marks along banks.
- Supply theft attempt: Longbottom stores targeted as cover for a mapping errand.
- False markers: ferrystone displaced to mislead depth/read of ford.
- Ledger hand: distinctive south‑run script appears in a village account.

## Objects & Evidence (mathoms and signs)
- Ferrystone (low‑water marker), lantern shutter, Ranger blind, river‑knot samples, boot sign vs. Bounder foot, willow chips, skiff scar on a post, a torn length of tarred sailcloth.

## Set‑Pieces (scene seeds)
- Dusk watch at the ford; fog rolls; mis‑signal the skiff using a shutter.
- Ranger lesson: reading boot sign; differentiating ferry use from probing.
- Hospitality test: Tolly shares stew with the deserter; truth without bullying.
- Longbottom ledger: Maralda catches the hand; quiet civic consequence.
- Hay Gate night: Bounders and Rangers exchange courtesy and protocol.
- Greenway tidings: a Ranger brings sober news of travelers waylaid; a leaf bale with foreign tally‑marks changes hands.
- Wolf‑sign at dawn: prints on the south bank; a single low shape glimpsed through mist, then gone.

## Tension Levers (canon‑safe, reusable)
- Tampered ferrystone: marker shifted two yards; scrape marks on gravel; line of false cairns nudges skiffs toward a bad channel.
- Foreign tally‑marks: leaf bales bound with black‑and‑green twine; a broad‑fingered hand mark pressed in wax; no names spoken.
- Crow‑mustering: dusk flights orbit the ford; one bird lingers near the blind and takes crumbs from a vagrant.
- Bounder out of place: a watchman fails to return at the bell; later found safe, misled by a reed‑whistle signal.
- Rope scar: fresh tar on a snagged stake; a torn scrap of sailcloth caught under roots.
- Distant horn: two faint blasts from south of the river on a wind‑turned night; not repeated.
- Warg rumor: Ranger finds a kill‑pattern and paw‑prints larger than wolf; no crossing into Shire lanes.

## Arcs (A/B/C)
- A (Tolly): curiosity → field‑competent investigator; keeps faith by documenting and preventing an incursion.
- B (Trust): Bounders/Shirriffs ↔ Rangers; shared signals/protocols agreed.
- C (Companions): Maralda’s evidence ethos; Tomberic’s courage with restraint.

## Acts (shape, not straitjacket)
- I. Shire calm with rumors; minor odd signs; decision to go.
- IIa. Learn river‑sign; first intercept fails; false trail to “poachers”; rumor of Greenway waylayings reaches the Hay Gate.
- Midpoint. Proof of mapping intent (knot code + cairn line).
- IIb. Stakes rise: attempted store theft as cover; courtesy frays; fog intercept; off‑shore wolf‑sign presses time pressure at the ford.
- III. Quiet resolution at the ford; warning delivered; signal network dismantled; records deposited.

### Near‑Miss Beats (to slot within Acts IIa/IIb)
- Lantern mis‑signal diverts a skiff onto a harmless shoal; rope snaps; tar scrap recovered (evidence).
- A reed‑whistle call lures a Bounder toward the bank; Tolly answers with a countersign learned from Rangers; the watcher stands down.
- False cairn line spotted under moonlight; Tomberic topples the leading stones; current changes expose true channel.

## Upheavals Beyond (tension dial, offstage)
- Isengard buyers: leaf trade via intermediaries; rogue tally‑marks appear on bales; hints that someone south maps river shallows and lanes.
- Greenway unrest: Rangers report waylayings; travelers go in twos; fires seen on downs far south.
- Crow‑kind gather in unusual numbers; flights at dusk behave like watchers.
- Gandalf cameo (canon‑safe): rumor or brief distant sighting near the Greenway; no fireworks, no overt meddling; a courteous message relayed through a Ranger (“keep the watches”).

## Songs (≤1 per chapter; 2–3 total)
- Hobbit walking song with river lexicon; a distant Ranger half‑lay overheard (untranslated fragment).

## Themes & Motifs
- Keeping watch vs. keeping faith; thresholds; small eucatastrophes; star + fire dyad; mathom‑logic; courtesy before courage.

## Red Herrings & Diversions
- Youths prank with knots; ferryman’s missing net; poacher sign mistaken for “enemy”; a festival errand in Longbottom.

## Glossary/Geography Seeds (to maintain)
- Ferrystone, Lantern Shutter, Ranger Blind, River‑knots, Cairn Mark; Waymeet, Overhill, Needlehole, Greenholm (already added; expand as needed).

## Risks & Rails (canon)
- No Nazgûl/Sharkey/Scouring; Rangers present but thin; Saruman never named on the page; scale remains local; conflict resolves by prudence and courtesy. Orc/warg presence appears as rumor, sign, or brief glimpse beyond the bounds—no pitched battle, no incursion into Shire lanes.

## Why This Prelude Matters (future tie‑ins)
- Leaf logistics: the ledger and tally‑marks foreshadow organized interest in Southfarthing leaf, linking to later troubles.
- Vulnerability map: the attempted survey and cairn line explain how outsiders learn Shire approaches.
- Courtesy under strain: Bounders and Rangers establish quiet protocols that will matter when the world darkens.
- Memory chain: Tolly’s evidence (tar scrap, tally‑marks, knot primer) forms a quiet record that later Shire folk will recall when new masters arrive.

## Open Questions (to answer in structural_plan.md)
- Exact order of waypoints (Hobbiton → Tookland → Longbottom → Sarn Ford → return?).
- How many on‑page nights at the ford (2–3)?
- Which chapters host the two key set‑pieces (ledger; fog intercept)?
- What token/change does Tolly bring back (a map correction? shared signal primer? proverb)?
