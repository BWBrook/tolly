# Middle-earth Fan-Fiction Research Bible (Late Third Age, Eriador) 

## 1. Locations in the Shire 
* **Overview:** The Shire is a small but fertile land in Eriador, granted to hobbits in T.A. 1601 by King Argeleb II of Arthedain. It measures about 120 miles (west-east) by 150 miles (north-south), divided into four Farthings (North, South, East, West). The Shire is largely pastoral: well-tended farms, gardens, and cozy villages. By late Third Age (~T.A. 3000), it contains around 30 villages and many hamlets. Key roads include the **Great East Road**, running through the Shire from the **Brandywine Bridge** (east border) across to the **Far Downs** (west border), and various byways linking towns. A peaceful people, hobbits maintain these roads and bridges as part of their ancient duty to the old kingdom. Below are important Shire locations and features, with both canonical details and notable fan-derived expansions. 
* **Michel Delving (Westfarthing):** The largest town and de facto capital of the Shire, located in the chalky White Downs of the Westfarthing. Its name means "large excavation," reflecting the many hobbit-holes dug into the hills. Michel Delving hosts the **Mayor’s offices**, the post and messenger system, and the Shirriffs’ headquarters (the Watch). A famous institution here is the **Mathom-house**, a museum for treasured curios (“mathoms”). It contains old weapons and artifacts, since in quieter times hobbits kept such items as curiosities. For instance, Bilbo Baggins’s mithril-mail shirt (won on his adventure) was displayed in the Mathom-house for years until he reclaimed it before leaving the Shire. Such relics, along with records kept by certain families, make Michel Delving a repository of Shire history. Local folklore and heirlooms (e.g. the club used by **Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took** to fell an orc-chief) might be found here. The town’s political leader is the elected Mayor of Michel Delving, who serves as both mayor and postmaster, but this role is mostly ceremonial and administrative. In fan adaptations (e.g. *The One Ring RPG* and MERP), Michel Delving is consistently portrayed as a bustling market town with inns and counting houses, reflecting its status as the Shire’s chief settlement.
* **Hobbiton & Bywater (Westfarthing):** Hobbiton is a classic rural village nestled in **The Water** valley. It is famed for its comfortable hobbit-holes like Bag End, well-tended farms, and the Party Tree field. By T.A. 3000, Hobbiton remains a quiet community of farmers and gardeners. Nearby **Bywater** hosts the Green Dragon Inn, a popular meeting place. Local geography includes **The Hill** (with Bagshot Row holes) and the Bywater Pool. Hobbiton’s inhabitants are mostly interrelated families (Bagginses, Gamgees, Sandymans, etc.), exemplifying typical Shire life with close-knit, rustic folk. Though unremarkable politically, Hobbiton’s central location on the East Road means travelers from other Shire regions pass through, sharing news at the inn. In fan extensions (e.g. *Lord of the Rings Online*), Hobbiton and Bywater are depicted with vibrant details: festivals on the Party Field, market stalls, and minor landmarks like **Sandyman’s Mill** on the Water. These embellishments align with Tolkien’s description of Hobbiton as the heart of the Shire’s pastoral charm.
* **Tuckborough (Westfarthing):** The ancestral seat of the Took clan in the Green Hills area. Here stands **Great Smials**, the large network of hobbit-holes housing the Thain’s family. Tuckborough is important in Shire governance: the Thain (head of the Took family) is the Shire’s traditional military leader (see Section 2). The community is known for a slightly more adventurous spirit and generosity. Canonically, Tuckborough is where **Gerontius, the Old Took** lived to 130, and many tales of sly “Tookish” behavior originate. Local customs include large birthday gatherings and a private mathom-room of the Tooks. Fan sources (MERP’s *The Shire* module) often elaborate on Tuckborough’s interior, imagining libraries of old tookish journals or secret tunnels. While these are speculative, they can add depth – for instance, a family record here might hint at ancient Took participation in historic events (like archers riding off to fight Angmar).
* **The Northfarthing (Northern Shire):** The least populated quarter, with cooler weather and moors. It’s known for the **Greenfields**, a region of rolling fields where the only battle within the Shire took place in 2747 T.A.. In that **Battle of Greenfields**, Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took led a troop of hobbits and famously struck off the goblin king Golfimbul’s head with a club, sending it down a rabbit hole – an event that Shire tales credit as the invention of the game of golf. This battle site near **Knockborne (Greenfields)** remains part of local lore. The Northfarthing also has the **Bindbole Wood** and the **North Moors**. It’s sparsely inhabited; one known village is **Long Cleeve**, home to a branch of the Took family (the North-Tooks). In Tolkien’s text, a hobbit (Sam Gamgee’s cousin Hal) claimed to see a “Tree-man” or walking giant in the Northfarthing beyond the North Moors – possibly an Ent or an Entwife, though hobbits treat it as a tall tale. This folklore adds a sense of the unknown to the far north of the Shire. **Hardbottle** is another settlement (mentioned as the home of the Bracegirdle family), though little is said of it in canon. Fan and RPG materials place Hardbottle in the Northfarthing hills. Notably, the Northfarthing is where heavy snow falls in the Fell Winter (T.A. 2911), and white wolves once invaded across the frozen Brandywine, an event still remembered in hobbit lore (see Section 2).
* **The Eastfarthing and Buckland:** The Eastfarthing contains farms and villages like **Stock**, **Frogmorton**, and **Whitfurrows**, and borders the **Brandywine River**. While the east is not on Tolly’s westward route, it’s relevant for context. Across the Brandywine is **Buckland**, settled by the Brandybuck family (who migrated from the Shire proper). Buckland (founded 2340 T.A.) is technically outside the Shire, but its hobbits share Shire culture with a few twists: they’re used to boating on the river and have a hedge (the High Hay) to guard against the Old Forest. Around T.A. 3000, Buckland folk and Shire folk interact at the Bridge and at markets, though Bucklanders are seen as “peculiar” (they lock their doors at night, and some even swim or sail boats – unusual habits to other hobbits). Buckland’s **Master (of Brandy Hall)** is the Brandybuck chieftain, analogous to the Thain in authority but only over Buckland. This region’s customs (like the **Harvestmath** fair in autumn) enrich any Shire story, though our tale mostly heads west and north.
* **Westfarthing West & the Far Downs:** At the western edge of the Shire stand the **Far Downs**, beyond which are the Tower Hills (Emyn Beraid). In the late Third Age, no official Shire settlements lie west of the Far Downs – the land beyond (later called the Westmarch) wasn’t granted to the Shire until Fourth Age 6. However, a few adventurous hobbits occasionally visit the Tower Hills to see the **Elven-towers** from afar. The village of **Undertowers** (established by the Fairbairn family after the War of the Ring) does not yet exist around 3000 T.A., but one might imagine isolated farmsteads near the border. The Great East Road runs out of the Shire here, continuing to the **Tower Hills** and beyond to the Grey Havens. **Waymeet** is the last Westfarthing village on the Road before one reaches the border; from there an old dwarf track leads to the Tower Hills. Canonically, most hobbits of this era have never been past the Far Downs, and consider the area “outside the Shire.” In a fan-fiction context, Tolly’s westward journey to the Tower Hills would be a remarkable adventure for a Shire native, leaving the familiar for the legendary West.
* **Fan Expansions – “Yondershire” and other villages:** Subsequent adaptations and games have added a few locales in or near the Shire. For example, *The Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO)* introduces **Needlehole** (a hamlet in the northwestern Shire, by the Rushock Bog) and **Dwaling** (in the far north of the Shire). These are not from Tolkien’s texts, but they flesh out the sparsely detailed regions. Notably, LOTRO’s Evendim region (just north of the Shire) includes **Oatbarton**, a hobbit village of oat-farmers at the Shire’s northern edge. In that adaptation, Oatbarton and surrounding farmlands (sometimes called the “Yondershire”) are depicted as the Shire’s northernmost agricultural outposts, famous for hearty crops and an annual market. Similarly, MERP (Middle-earth Role Playing, by I.C.E.) and other RPGs have posited a village actually named **Sackville** in the Southfarthing – an extrapolation from the surname Sackville-Baggins. This idea, suggested in Karen Fonstad’s *Atlas of Middle-earth*, imagines a settlement in the Southfarthing where the Sackville family originated. While Tolkien never mentions a real place called Sackville (he only used it as part of a family name), such fan additions are “reasonable” interpolations to explain Shire surnames. As a writer, you may or may not incorporate these non-canonical locales. They can provide extra stops or flavor (e.g. a quick visit to Oatbarton’s market on the way north, encountering local gossip), but it’s important to distinguish them from Tolkien’s established geography. Canonically, the Shire’s own corners already offer plenty of diversity – from the Michel Delving bustle, to Hobbiton’s green hills, to the remote moors of the Northfarthing – enough to fuel an authentic hobbit journey.
* **Local Roads and Paths:** The Shire is crisscrossed by well-trodden roads and country lanes rather than any great highways. The **Great East Road** (built by the old kingdom) enters at the Brandywine Bridge (once the *Bridge of Stonebows*, maintained by the King’s subjects) and runs through central Shire. It passes by villages like Whitfurrows, Frogmorton, Bywater, and Michel Delving, before exiting westward. Many smaller roads branch off: for instance, the **Stock Road** leads southeast to Stock and the Bucklebury Ferry; the **East Road** has a spur at Waymeet going south toward the Southfarthing; and lanes connect farming hamlets to their market towns. Hobbits also use footpaths extensively: one famous route is the walking trail through the **Woody End** in the Eastfarthing, where Frodo and friends encountered elves. Similarly, paths run over the Green Hills from Tookland toward the Marish. By late Third Age, these routes are safe and well-maintained within the Shire. A notable feature are the border walkers called **Bounders** (see Section 2), who patrol the edges along unofficial paths. For Tolly’s adventure, the journey likely starts on the Great Road west to the Tower Hills. From there, going north to Lake Evendim means leaving roads entirely – traversing the open North Moors or following vague old trails used by hunters. This would be a dramatic shift from the neatly ordered roads of the Shire to the wild, pathless lands of Eriador (detailed in Section 3).
* **Customs and Folklore:** Each Shire locale has its own little customs, but some are widespread. Hobbits celebrate birthdays with parties and lavish gift-giving (especially in affluent families like the Sacks in Sackville or the Tooks of Tuckborough). There are annual events such as **Mid-year’s Day (Lithe)** feasts and seasonal market-fairs in Michel Delving and other towns. Storytelling is a common evening pastime; local taverns (the Green Dragon in Bywater, the Ivy Bush near Hobbiton, the Golden Perch in Stock, etc.) are venues for exchanging news and legends. Folklore in the Shire is rich but often kept lighthearted. For example, Hobbits tell of **Bandobras Took (Bullroarer)** and how his heroism against goblins inadvertently created the game of golf – a tale recounted with much laughter at Green Dragon gatherings. There are also ghost stories and marvels: Sam Gamgee relates hearing about “Tree-men… one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors” from his cousin Halfast. Such stories of walking giants or ghosts in the Old Forest are usually met with skepticism or amusement by other hobbits (“maybe you’ve had a drop too much ale, cousin?”), yet they hint at the wider world’s mysteries. Importantly, hobbits have folklore about the greater world that is fragmentary: they know of **King Gil-galad** and the old wars only through nursery rhymes (Sam knows a bit of Gil-galad’s fall but learned it from Bilbo’s translations). In the Shire, the **Sea** is a distant, almost mythical concept – the very word can bring on a strange sadness or yearning in those with Tookish blood, though most hobbits have never seen it. Elves are figures from old tales; a rare hobbit might claim to have spotted an Elf in the woods, but this is exceedingly uncommon (when Frodo met elves in 3018, it was unprecedented enough to be a lifelong memory). Superstitions also exist: hobbits tilt their hats to a **farmer’s star (the Sickle)** in the night sky for good harvest, or avoid the **Barrow-downs** (beyond the Shire) due to ghost fables. A good research bible compiles these small cultural details because they add realism – for example, Tolly and friends might encourage each other with “Remember the Bullroarer!” in jest, or feel a shiver of excitement (and fear) if one claims to see an Elven-light in the Tower Hills at dusk. **Summary (Shire Locations):** In crafting the Shire portion of the story, rely on Tolkien’s vivid descriptions of a rural English-style countryside with a gentle pace of life. The canonical locations – Michel Delving, Hobbiton, Tookland, the Greenfields, etc. – provide the backbone. Fan expansions (villages like Oatbarton or Sackville) can be used sparingly to fill gaps, but they should be clearly separate in your notes (so you know what’s pure Tolkien vs. later invention). Emphasize local color: the proud Michel Delving mayor and the dusty Mathom-house records, the green quiet of Hobbiton’s evening, the misty moors of the Northfarthing with their whispered legends. All these will ground your fan-fiction in a *real-feeling* Shire, from which the larger adventure launches. 

## 2. Culture, Attitudes, and History of Hobbits 
**Hobbit Society around T.A. 3000:** Hobbits at the end of the Third Age are a peaceful, insular people. “At no time had hobbits of any kind been warlike,” Tolkien notes, and by Bilbo’s time their old fights had long faded into legend. They love farming, eating, and gathering with friends – a contented society that values comfort and routine. Daily life revolves around simple pleasures: most hobbits are farmers, millers, innkeepers, gardeners, or tradesmen serving local needs. Six meals a day (when they can) are customary – breakfast, second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, and dinner – which is a telling sign of their leisurely lifestyle. The average hobbit is fond of **ale and pipe-weed** (tobacco); the Southfarthing’s **Longbottom Leaf** pipe-weed is especially esteemed, and sharing a pipe at the pub is a nightly ritual for many. Dress is unassuming: bright but practical fabrics, with a preference for yellows and greens. Even affluent families (like the genteel Bagginses or the aristocratic Tooks) maintain a down-to-earth lifestyle by human standards – their wealth shows in well-stocked pantries and handsome smials rather than ostentation. By Shire Reckoning 1400s (equivalent to T.A. 3000s), hobbit society has been stable and prosperous for many generations, having largely forgotten the hardship of earlier times. **Social Structure:** Hobbit society has minimal hierarchy. There is no functioning monarchy or aristocracy in the Shire (since the ancient Kings of Arnor are long gone). Instead, informal prominence is given to certain families (Tooks, Brandybucks, etc.) and the elected **Mayor of Michel Delving** (who handles postal duties and presides at banquets, but wields little real power). The **Thain** is the closest thing to a political leader in an emergency – the head of the Took family, who is “captain of the Shire-muster and Hobbitry-in-arms” if needed. However, by this era the Thain’s role is mostly ceremonial; the Shire hasn’t mustered a armed troop in living memory. Day-to-day, hobbits govern themselves locally: villages have informal councils or influential elders (e.g. the Master of Buckland among the Brandybucks, the family heads in Michel Delving, etc.). Disputes are rare and usually settled by **Shirriffs** – the Shire’s only police, of which there are very few. (There are “three Shirriffs for each Farthing” plus a group of **Bounders** who watch the borders.) The Bounders especially are noteworthy: they are volunteers who “keep strangers out of the Shire” and an eye on odd happenings. This implies that hobbits do have a concept of community defense, albeit a very low-key one. **Typical Attitudes:** Around T.A. 3000, most hobbits are content and parochial. They “avoid the Big People,” generally distrust anything unfamiliar, and prefer well-ordered predictability. Technologically and culturally, they are rustic: they have no industry beyond local crafts. They like things that grow (crops, gardens) and have a deep love of good tilled earth. Magic is not part of their everyday life, and they regard talk of dragons, wars, or sorcery as at best amusing stories, at worst frightening nonsense. As Tolkien writes, hobbits are “slow to quarrel, and for sport kill nothing that lives” – they’re a gentle folk – **but** “at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark”. This encapsulates a key aspect of hobbit culture: a hidden resilience. They are laughable to some (even their human neighbors in Bree see them as harmless), yet hobbits have courage and resourcefulness when driven by necessity or love of home. The Scouring of the Shire in 3019 (though beyond our current timeframe) ultimately shows that spirit. For Tolly’s story set just before the War of the Ring, you can emphasize how unusual it is for young hobbits to *want* adventure – “aventures” are things that normal hobbits avoid. Tolly, being an orphan from the northern Shire, might already be a bit of an outsider (no large family clan, perhaps a dreamer influenced by hearing old tales). His friends from Michel Delving and Hobbiton could likewise be unusual individuals – perhaps one is bookish or has heard Bilbo’s stories, another might be a Tookish sort with a curiosity for the world. Such characters would be seen by their neighbors as “queer” but not bad. In fact, the Shire has a concept of “respectability” that equates to staying home, tending one’s garden, and never doing anything unexpected. Those who stray from this, like Bilbo Baggins with his adventure, earn a dubious reputation. Expect that Tolly and companions, if they announce or show signs of setting off on travels, would elicit reactions from concern to mockery from other hobbits (“Going on a journey *outside* the Shire? Madness! Have you been listening to too many of old Mr. Bilbo’s tales?”). **Historical Interactions with Other Peoples:** Hobbits have had limited direct dealings with other races by the late Third Age, but there are a few significant points: 
* **Men (Dúnedain Rangers and Bree-folk):** The Shire was originally part of the North Kingdom of Arnor. Hobbits swore nominal allegiance to the Kings of Arnor/Arthedain, maintaining roads and bridges for them. After Arnor’s fall (T.A. 1975), the Shirefolk were effectively self-governing, and contact with the outside world waned. By T.A. 3000, most Shire hobbits have never met Men (except possibly the Bree-landers, and Bree is a distant town to the east). One exception is the secret protection by the **Rangers of the North**. The Rangers (remnant Dúnedain of Arnor) roam Eriador and often guard the borders of the Shire unseen. Their efforts kept the Shire safe from many threats without the hobbits even knowing. Indeed, when the Rangers briefly “all went away” in 3018 to fight in the south, the Bree-landers quickly realized how crucial they had been: wolves and strange dark creatures began to trouble the land. Butterbur the innkeeper said, “We’ve not rightly understood till now what they did for us… there’s been worse than robbers about: wolves were howling round the fences last winter, and dark shapes in the woods”. This underscores that Rangers quietly dealt with dangers before they reached Shire folks. However, direct interaction between hobbits and Rangers was minimal. A few hobbits (like the educated members of the Took and Brandybuck families, or Bilbo and Frodo) knew of the Rangers in vague terms or had glimpsed a grim wanderer on the road. Generally, though, Rangers were a mystery – often viewed with suspicion if seen at all. (In Bree, “Strider” was considered a scoundrel by those who didn’t know better, and hobbits would likely be even more wary.) Historically, the ties go deeper: the hobbits remember that the **King** gave them the land. In Shire tradition, they would recognize a King’s rule again if one returned. This is why, after Arnor’s fall, they elected their own Thain “to hold the authority of the King” until such time as the King might come back. But in practice, by T.A. 3000, the idea of a King is just a ceremonial toast at parties (“The Queen of the Shire” was a jest for a generous hostess, etc.). In summary, hobbits and Men (particularly the Dúnedain) had an old alliance that by this time survives mostly in forgotten obligation and the Rangers’ secret watchfulness. There are also **Bree-Men** (ordinary folk of Bree, Staddle, etc.) who trade occasionally with the Shire – especially for pipe-weed. Some Bree-men know of the Shire and vice versa; for instance, the Brandybucks of Buckland are friendly with the Bree-folk just a ferry and a day’s ride away. Still, even this contact is limited – a Shire farmer might occasionally see a Bree merchant at the Bridge exchanging goods, but many hobbits lived their whole lives without meeting Big People.
* **Dwarves:** Hobbits generally got on better with Dwarves than with other outsiders. The Shire lies on the road that Dwarves travel between the Blue Mountains (Ered Luin) in the west and their kingdoms or mines in the east (such as the Lonely Mountain after T.A. 2941). Tolkien notes that Harfoots (one of the hobbit strains) “had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times”. By the late Third Age, it’s not uncommon for a troop of Dwarves to pass through the Shire along the East Road. Bilbo’s famous adventure began with the arrival of Thorin Oakenshield and company at Bag End, an event so unusual that it’s remembered years later. But smaller encounters happened quietly: Dwarves would sometimes bring toys or fine tools to trade (we see in *The Hobbit* that Dwarf-made toys delighted Shire youngsters at parties). Hobbits are polite but not overly curious about Dwarves – they might share a mug at an inn, or sell produce to a traveling dwarf in exchange for a few silver coins. The overall attitude: dwarves are strange and a bit comical (short but bearded and heavy-booted, quite unlike beardless, shoeless hobbits), but not as threatening as Big Folk. After Bilbo’s adventure (which took place in 2941 T.A.), there was likely some increased local interest in Dwarves—if only because Bilbo became friends with some. We know that Dwarves visited Bilbo in Hobbiton occasionally after his return (he maintained friendships with the Dwarf messengers from the Lonely Mountain). Thus, a well-informed hobbit around 3000 T.A. might have heard news of distant lands via Dwarves. For example, rumors of the Dragon’s death (Smaug) and the restoration of the Kingdom under the Mountain might have spread. Generally, however, such news was viewed as far-off and inconsequential to daily Shire life.
* **Elves:** Direct contact between hobbits and Elves was *very* rare by the end of the Third Age. Nonetheless, hobbits hold Elves in awe in their stories – they’re the “Good People” or “Fair Folk” who appear in old poems. A small number of hobbits have actually seen Elves passing: e.g. the wandering companies of Elves from Lindon occasionally travel eastward near the Shire. There’s a recorded instance in September 3018 T.A. when Frodo Baggins and friends encounter **Gildor Inglorion** and his band of Elves in the Shire’s woods. Before that, Sam Gamgee had longed to see Elves at least once – implying that for most hobbits this would be a once-in-a-lifetime marvel. The cultural attitude is a mix of fascination and fear: Elves are respected and somewhat feared (not in the sense of terror, but an almost superstitious reverence). Hobbit lore doesn’t distinguish between types of Elves (they wouldn’t know a Noldo from a Sindar, etc.), but they generally assume Elves are kind (if potentially mischievous) and associated with stars and song. One common hobbit saying for wonderment is “*Elf-fashion!*” – for example, describing something crafty or magical that they don’t understand. This indicates they attribute enchantment or great skill to Elves. In our story’s context, if an Elf or half-elf ranger appears (see Section 4), the hobbits would likely be astonished and tongue-tied at first. Historically, Fallohide hobbits (the more adventurous breed) were said to have more dealings with Elves during the migration west in the First Millennium of the Third Age, and some Fallohide families (like the Tooks) passed down tales or perhaps a bit of Elvish linguistic influence (some Hobbit names or words—like *mathom*—come from old languages indirectly related to the Common Tongue). But by 3000 T.A., any such connection is attenuated. Culturally, hobbits don’t *expect* to meet Elves; those who express interest in Elves, like young Samwise did, might get teased for believing in “fairy-tales.”
* **Other Hobbits (Bree and Wild Hobbits):** It’s worth noting that not all hobbits live in the Shire. A small community of hobbits exists in **Bree-land** (Bree, Staddle, Combe, Archet), where they live alongside Men. The Shire folk are aware of Bree-hobbits; indeed, the Shire’s founders originally came from Bree. By the late Third Age, there’s minimal contact, but some traders might exchange goods (pipe-weed from Southfarthing was sold to Bree, for example). When Shire hobbits think of Bree-hobbits, they consider them distant cousins – a bit “odd” for living among Big Folk, but still hobbits. There were also rumors of hobbits in far places historically (some Stoors lived near the River **Gladden** far to the east around the Anduin, but those had died out or disappeared long ago – Smeagol/Gollum was one of those, though the Shire folks have no knowledge of him). For Shire historians like Bilbo, these tales of ancient hobbit migrations exist (he wrote of the three breeds: Harfoot, Stoor, Fallohide in his studies), but the common hobbit doesn’t concern themselves with it. They just know “we folk have always been here in the Shire” (conveniently forgetting the journey from Bree 1400 years ago). **Hobbit “Military” History and Fighting Skills:** While hobbits are not warriors by nature, they are far from defenseless. Canon provides a few instances of hobbits in armed conflict: 
* **The Battle of Greenfields (T.A. 2747):** This is the clearest example of a hobbit militia in action. Golfimbul’s orc-band from Mount Gram invaded the Northfarthing, and the hobbits famously “met them in the Greenfields” led by Bandobras Took. The hobbits armed themselves with whatever they had (clubs, axes, bows) and managed to rout the intruders. Bandobras’s strength and 4’5” height allowed him to literally behead the goblin king, ending the battle decisively. This event is important in Shire lore as proof that hobbits *can* fight bravely when pressed. It was, until the War of the Ring, the only battle actually fought *inside* the Shire (aside from the brief **Battle of Bywater** in 3019). After Greenfields, the Shire had peace for many generations, but the memory endured in song and family legend (especially among the Tooks). Tolkien even mentions there remained a few Mathoms (trophies) from that battle – for instance, the horn that Bullroarer Took blew to gather the hobbits was kept at Great Smials, and some odd weapons taken from defeated goblins might still be in the Mathom-house.
* **Archers of the Shire in the service of the King (Angmar War):** During the final war against Angmar, it is recorded in Shire tradition that hobbits sent a token force to aid the lost King of Arthedain. In 1974 T.A., King Arvedui made a desperate stand against the Witch-king of Angmar. The hobbits “maintain that they sent a company of archers to help” at the **Battle of Fornost**, though this deed “is nowhere else recorded” in the official histories. This suggests that a small regiment of hobbit archers mustered and marched north to fight alongside the King’s men. Perhaps they were too few to be noted by chronicles, or arrived too late to affect the outcome, but the Shire-folk kept the memory alive among themselves. Immediately after that war, the kingdom fell and communication between the Shire and the outside broke down. The hobbit archers presumably never returned or gradually disappeared from memory, becoming a legend of “the Shire-folk who fought in the King’s battle.” By T.A. 3000, almost 1000 years later, this is a half-forgotten tale – indeed “many therefore also forgot that Hobbits had actually gone to the aid of the King… and sent some Hobbit archers”. Nonetheless, it’s an inspiring precedent for Tolly’s quest: the idea that hobbits *once* took up bows and stood with the Rangers. This can fuel his determination, even as other hobbits might laugh at it as just a yarn. (Section 5 will delve more into this “lost regiment” story and how it might be pieced together.)
* **The Fell Winter and Battle of the Wolves (T.A. 2911-2912):** This was not a formal battle, but during the brutal winter of 2911 when the Brandywine River froze, white **wolves** from the north crossed into the Shire. The Shire-hobbits had to defend their flocks and homes, particularly in the Northfarthing and around the eastern borders. There are no detailed chronicles of this, but one can assume bands of farmers and bounders drove off the wolves with bows and spears. Even as late as 3001, older folk like Bilbo or the Gaffer remember that winter as a time of hardship and uncommon danger. It’s one reason the Bounders still lightly patrol – the threat of wolves (or perhaps stray goblins from Mount Gram) is remote but not impossible. Culturally, this gave hobbits a saying like “we haven’t had it so bad since the Fell Winter.”
* **The “Shire-muster” and Weapons:** The Shire by and large had no standing army, but they did have the concept of the **Hobbitry-in-arms** under the Thain’s command. Every able hobbit could be called upon to defend their land in great need. Tolkien tells us that in Bilbo’s time “there was still some store of weapons in the Shire”, including some preserved in the Mathom-house. These likely include swords or axes taken from orcs long ago, or made by Dwarf-smiths for the Shire, and a good number of bows. Archery was a common skill for hunting small game (rabbits, birds) and for sport at fairs. Hobbits are naturally excellent marksmen with thrown stones – an ability for which they’re quietly famous (if a hobbit “stooped for a stone, it was well for the enemy to duck,” goes one jest; indeed in the Battle of Bywater in 3019, thrown stones were the first volley against ruffians). With bows, their keen eyesight makes them surprisingly good shots. We can imagine village archery competitions at mid-year festivals, meaning that even those who have never seen real combat know how to handle a bow. During the Scouring of the Shire (late 3019), many hobbits swiftly armed themselves with axes, hay-forks, and a few old swords or bows to oust the ruffians – showing that the latent courage and fighting spirit can ignite given a just cause.
* **Militia Structure (Shirriffs and Bounders):** As mentioned, the only formal peacekeepers in the Shire are the **Shirriffs**. There are twelve total (three per Farthing) plus additional **Bounders** for boundary defense. In peaceful times, their job is mainly to shoo away trespassing beasts or tramps, and to deal with occasional mischief (like theft of crops or squabbles at the inn). They wear a feather in their cap as a badge of office. The Thain, if he ever had to muster an army, would presumably rally the Shirriff-leaders and raise the “hobbitholds” under each family’s leadership. Historically, we know the Thainship was established when the kings were gone, the first Thain being Bucca of the Marish in 1979 T.A. (just after Fornost fell). The position then passed to the Oldbucks and later the Tooks, who hold it through T.A. 3000. Paladin Took II is the current Thain (Pippin’s father) around 3000. Under Paladin (who in 3019 does in fact muster the Tooks to resist ruffians), there likely exists a rudimentary preparedness: perhaps a few sheds of old pikes and arrows in Tookland, and a horn-call system (the Tooks have the ancient Horn of the Mark, actually a gift from Rohan, used in 3019). While none of this is active during peacetime, it provides a plausible background for how hobbits *could* organize. In a fan-fiction, one might depict Tolly or friends consulting an old Shire record or family tradition – for example, the **Red Book of Westmarch** (started by Bilbo and Frodo) or the **Yearbook of Tuckborough** (an in-universe document that might list notable Took heroes) – to learn about Bandobras or the archers of Fornost. These could reveal that hobbits had captains, archers, and even basic tactics (the Bullroarer’s charge at Greenfields, etc.). **Outsiders’ Views & Hobbit Self-Perception:** Hobbits are humble and don’t glorify war. They see their past brave deeds as curious exceptions. A hobbit would say, “We are plain folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing things!” (as Bilbo once firmly stated before adventure found him). They take pride in their quietness. Yet, it’s precisely this un-warlike nature that can make their rare acts of heroism so poignant. In writing hobbit characters, emphasize this contrast: Tolly and his friends might feel stirrings of bravery or wanderlust that conflict with their upbringing. Perhaps one of them quotes an old proverb like, *“Soft as butter they may think us, but when the time comes, we can be as tough as old tree-roots.”* Indeed, Tolkien’s text notes that hobbits can “still handle arms” in desperate times. They also have a streak of stubborn loyalty – Samwise charging a giant spider or Merry stabbing the Witch-king are extreme examples in the War of the Ring. In the calmer days of 3000, this quality might show in steadfast determination to pursue an important truth (like Tolly’s quest to uncover the story of the lost archers). Moreover, historically hobbits have interacted peacefully with their neighbors when encountered. For instance, the Shire stayed neutral or unnoticed during the great events of the Third Age, but individuals like Bilbo and Frodo earned the admiration of Men, Elves, and Dwarves once their deeds were revealed. In our context (just pre-War), if Tolly’s company meets Dwarves or a Ranger or an Elf on their journey, those outsiders might initially underestimate the halflings. But the hobbits’ courtesy, resilience, and surprising knowledge (say, reciting a bit of an old poem) could win respect. A Ranger might recall the tale of Bandobras and salute them for it, or an Elf might be amused and charmed by their simple goodness. To sum up this section: **Hobbit culture** is defined by peace, comfort, and a love of home. **Their attitude** to the wider world is cautious and dismissive on the surface, but curious or adventurous individuals do exist (often Fallohide-influenced or with personal motivations like Tolly’s). **History** shows hobbits as negligible in the grand wars – save for a few small bright moments where they fought for their own survival or honor. This makes the premise of a hobbit-sized adventure very fitting: it’s a chance for these little people to connect with a grand history that most of their kin have forgotten. Anchoring Tolly’s quest in known hobbit history (Greenfields, the Fornost archers) provides realism and weight to his story, while still respecting that hobbits in general remain modest and pacifist. 

## 3. Tower Hills, Lake Evendim, Annúminas, Fornost, and Surrounding Regions 
As Tolly and his companions venture beyond the Shire, they enter lands that were once the heart of the **North Kingdom (Arnor)** but are now largely wild and sparsely inhabited. This section outlines each major location on their route – the Tower Hills, Lake Evendim, Annúminas, Fornost – with an eye to their **canonical history, current state circa T.A. 3000, and what the hobbits might know or discover about them**. Also included is relevant background on Arnor’s fall and the presence of Rangers and legends in these areas. **Tower Hills (Emyn Beraid) and Elostirion:** The Tower Hills are a line of steep hills just west of the Shire’s border (beyond the Far Downs). They are notable for the trio of ancient towers built on their summits. The tallest tower is **Elostirion**, one of the White Towers. In **Elostirion** resided one of the seven seeing-stones, the **Palantír of Elendil**, also called Elendil’s Stone. This palantír was unique – it looked west across the Sea toward the Undying Lands and was not in communication with the other stones. After the fall of Arnor, the **High Elves of Lindon (Gil-galad’s people, now led by Círdan the Shipwright)** took custodianship of the Tower and the stone. No Man was allowed to use it, and it remained a secret relic. By the late Third Age, *Elves still visit and maintain the Tower Hills*. It’s said that Elves keep a watch there until the last ship sails. In fact, after the War of the Ring, Elrond carried this palantír onto the ship to the West (so it left Middle-earth in 3021 T.A.). For Tolly’s time (~3000 T.A.), this means the Tower Hills have an eerie yet peaceful atmosphere – ancient empty towers, maybe an elf or two tending them occasionally. The Shire-folk see the distant silhouettes of these towers on a clear day from the westernmost parts of the Shire. There’s a legend among them that you can see the sea from the top of the White Towers (indeed, Elendil’s Stone gave visions of the sea). However, no ordinary hobbit has ever been up there. Hobbits might refer to them simply as the “**Elf-towers**.” In the Red Book (the hobbits’ chronicled lore after the fact), Samwise mentions the Tower Hills when he leaves Middle-earth (he traveled there in Fourth Age). But in 3000 T.A., perhaps only the most curious Shire scholars like Frodo or Merry would know any detail: maybe Bilbo told them that “there’s a palantír up there” (though that might be too specific – likely not, as Bilbo didn’t know). More plausibly, the narrative could have the hobbits meet an Elf at the Towers who explains some of the history. The **geography** around the Tower Hills: green, windswept heights with remnants of old stonework. The towers themselves are tall, grey, and elegant, of obvious Elven craft (or Númenórean craft influenced by Elves). At the foot of the hills on the east side, one comes from the Shire; on the west side of the hills, the land begins to slope down toward the Gulf of Lune and Mithlond (the Grey Havens) far beyond. There is an ancient westward road (the continuation of the East Road) skirting the south of the Tower Hills toward Mithlond. If Tolly’s company climb the hills, they might find an Elf-stone marking or an ancient star emblem of Elendil. Canonically, **Círdan’s people** maintain a small presence here – possibly a few Silvan-Elf wardens guarding Elostirion. It’s quite conceivable for the story to introduce an **Elf (or half-elf) character at the Tower Hills** who becomes a guide or source of information (we’ll discuss plausibility of an Elven ranger in Section 4). In terms of **connection to Arnor**: The Tower Hills marked essentially the far west reach of Arnor’s settled lands. When Arnor flourished (Second Age end and early Third Age), these towers were important beacons. After Arnor’s division, they fell into the realm of Arthedain (the successor kingdom that included the Shire and beyond). When Arthedain was lost, the towers stood vacant except for Elven guardians. Thus, the Tower Hills are a tangible link for our hobbits between the comfortable Shire and the grand but lost civilization of the Dúnedain. Standing atop Elostirion’s hill, one could poetically feel the **“sea breeze”** and glimpse far-off waters, giving perhaps Tolly’s first view of how wide the world truly is. **Lake Evendim (Nenuial) and Annúminas:** Moving north from the Tower Hills about 60-70 miles one enters the lands around Lake Evendim. **Lake Evendim**, in Elvish *Nenuial* (“Lake of Twilight”), is a large lake amid gentle hills and grassy plains. It was a centerpiece of the Kingdom of Arnor. On its southern shore stood **Annúminas**, the first capital city of Arnor, founded by Elendil in S.A. 3320 / T.A. 1. The name Annúminas means “Tower of the West (Sunset)” – it was a proud city built along the shore, housing the king’s palace and one of the palantíri. For several centuries, Annúminas was the seat of the Kings of Arnor. However, as Arnor’s population declined and the realm eventually split (in T.A. 861), Annúminas was slowly abandoned. By the time the North Kingdom had splintered into Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur, the capital had moved to **Fornost Erain** (in Arthedain). Annúminas fell into ruin long before the final wars with Angmar. By late Third Age, Annúminas is a desolate but imposing ruin. Tolkien doesn’t describe it in detail in the main narrative, since no characters visit it in *The Lord of the Rings*, but the reader knows it’s there – a memory of lost grandeur. Likely features: fallen grey walls, crumbling quays on the lakeshore, maybe a few roofless great halls and the base of a tall tower or two. Some shards of Númenórean architecture (columns, stone bridges, steps) would remain, overgrown with ivy and washed by rain. The lake itself is pristine, fed by streams from the North Downs and drained by the **Baranduin River** – yes, the Brandywine begins as the outflow of Lake Evendim. So interestingly, the same Brandywine that flows past the Shire begins up here at Evendim’s south-east end. This means if the hobbits follow the Brandywine northwards (on its west bank) they could naturally come to Evendim. What would hobbits know of Annúminas? Almost nothing firsthand. In Hobbit lore, even the name Annúminas might not be known (perhaps in a few old stories or in Bilbo’s translations of Elven lore). They do speak of kings coming from “**Norbury**” (which is Fornost, see below) or of the *treasures of Westernesse*, but that’s vague. Annúminas, having been deserted for two millennia, likely doesn’t feature in any hobbit tales except perhaps as “the old city by the lake.” If the characters meet a knowledgeable Ranger or Elf, they could learn the name and significance. Without guidance, the hobbits might refer to it as *“the Dead City on the lake”* or some such term they invent. From a storytelling perspective, Annúminas could provide a dramatic setting: imagine the three hobbits wandering through an echoing, empty city at twilight, with Lake Nenuial’s waters lapping at broken docks. They might find, for example, an ancient **carving or inscription** (in Tengwar or Númenórean script) which they cannot read, but which an educated companion (like an Elf or Ranger) later interprets for them – perhaps a dedication to Elendil or a tomb marker of an Arnorian prince. This can reinforce the weight of history. It’s also a place where physical **evidence of the hobbit archers** might be found: since the lost regiment presumably came to Fornost’s aid (slightly east of here), one could imagine that some passed by Annúminas or that survivors retreated this way. LOTRO actually uses Annúminas as a location full of tombs and lingering evil, but canonically we aren’t told of any specific evil here. It’s likely quiet, but possibly home to a few wild creatures (maybe trolls or squatters from Angmar had lairs around at times). One notable canonical detail: After the War of the Ring, King Elessar (Aragorn) rebuilds Annúminas and dwells there at times in the Fourth Age. But in 3000 T.A., it’s still in ruin, awaiting the return of a king. Therefore, you can imbue it with a sense of “waiting” and faded glory. **The North Downs and Fornost Erain:** Northeast of Lake Evendim stretch the **North Downs**, a series of hills and ridges running west-east. On the southern edge of the North Downs stood **Fornost Erain** (Sindarin for “Northern Fortress of the Kings”), also called **Norbury of the Kings** by Men of Arnor. Fornost became the capital of Arthedain after Annúminas was abandoned, certainly by the Ninth Century of the Third Age. It was a walled city/fortress on a high strategic position at the north end of the Greenway (the Great North-South Road). In its heyday, Fornost guarded the kingdom’s northern frontier and the approaches to Annúminas. Unfortunately, Fornost is better known for its fall: in T.A. 1974, the Witch-king of Angmar captured Fornost, overthrowing the last King of Arthedain (Arvedui). The following year, Prince Eärnur of Gondor, with elves of Lindon (like Glorfindel), came and defeated Angmar’s army in the **Battle of Fornost** – driving the Witch-king away. But they came too late to save the kingdom. Fornost was left a devastated site, and no new kingdom was founded (the Dúnedain became wandering Rangers). Over the next thousand years, Fornost’s ruins gained a sinister reputation among local folk. By the time of *The Lord of the Rings*, the people of Bree refer to Fornost as **Deadmen’s Dike**, believing it haunted and avoiding it at all costs. Butterbur calls it “haunted land, they say. None but a robber would go there,” to which Gandalf replies, “The Rangers go there… its right name is Fornost Erain, Norbury of the Kings”. This dialogue highlights two things: common folk (including Breeland hobbits) think the place is full of ghosts, while the Rangers know it as an important historic site and still visit it. Indeed, Gandalf even prophesies that the King will come there again one day – which comes true when Aragorn as King Elessar tours the North and likely refounds a presence at Fornost. For your story around 3000 T.A., Fornost is an imposing ruin on the horizon as the hobbits approach from the west (Evendim) or south. It likely sits on a rise above the plain, with broken walls and perhaps one or two towers still standing against the sky. The atmosphere should be eerie. If the hobbits arrive towards evening, mists might collect and one could easily play on the “haunted” feel. Perhaps they think they see shapes (which could just be Ranger lookouts or old stone statues appearing like figures in the fog). **Geography note:** The distance from Annúminas (on Lake Evendim) to Fornost is not huge – maybe a day or two’s journey eastwards. They might travel along the line of the Baranduin (Brandywine) or along remnants of an ancient road. There was an old road that connected Annúminas to Fornost (though in disrepair by Third Age end). The Greenway (North-South Road) runs a few miles east of Fornost, coming up from Bree. So travelers from Bree typically turned off the Greenway to reach Fornost. In open-world terms, the North Downs around Fornost are grassy with patches of woods and many broken stone remains (watch-towers, causeways, etc., as Arnor had various outposts). **Rangers’ presence:** The Dúnedain Rangers frequently patrol these areas – Fornost, Evendim, the North Downs – because Angmar’s old strongholds (to the farther north in the mountains of Angmar) still occasionally spew out orcs or evil creatures. There are also **tombs of the Arnorian kings** in the Barrow-downs far to the south (near Bree), but in the Evendim/Fornost vicinity there might be graves of nobility or battle dead. The Rangers keep an eye especially on Fornost, lest any darkness (such as Barrow-wights or other spirits) infest it. The fan-fiction could involve finding traces of a Ranger encampment: e.g. a hidden cache of supplies in a ruin, or carved Ranger marks signaling safe paths. It is likely that Aragorn himself, in his youth, visited Fornost and Annúminas; and certainly other Rangers (like Halbarad or the sons of Elrond) know these places well. If Tolly’s party is searching for clues about the lost hobbit archers, the **Rangers** would be keenly interested – they might have heard garbled legends of small archers at Fornost, and it ties into their own heritage (since those hobbits fought in defense of the Rangers’ ancestors). **Local Legends and Knowledge (for Hobbits):** Within the Shire, any knowledge of these northern locales is minimal. Perhaps a well-traveled Brandybuck or Took might have heard names like “Fornost” or “the Norbury” from Bilbo’s stories or in old records, but they wouldn’t know specifics. The journey of our hobbits is one of discovery. They will learn as the reader learns. They might call Evendim simply *“the lake”* until someone teaches them the name “Nenuial.” Initially, they may not realize Annúminas was a city of the King – they could think Fornost was the only battlefield to investigate. One can have them stumble on Annúminas unexpectedly (“we found a whole city in ruins on the lake shore!”). If one of Tolly’s companions is studious (say, the Michel Delving hobbit might have browsed the Mathom-house manuscripts), he could recall a snippet: e.g. “I remember something about *Annúminas*… could this be it?” This gives an opportunity to incorporate Appendix information organically. **Angmar’s Shadow:** Even though Angmar was defeated in 1975, its legacy persists in the north. Evil spirits known as **Barrow-wights** came later (in TA 1636 the Witch-king sent them to Cardolan’s barrows after the Great Plague) – that’s more in the Barrow-downs near Bree, not at Fornost. However, one might speculate there could be lingering spirits on the North Downs too. If the story takes a slightly spooky turn, the hobbits could experience mild supernatural dread at Fornost (feelings of cold or sorrow, etc., perhaps remnants of the Witch-king’s sorcery). Such an atmosphere aligns with Butterbur’s “haunted land” comment. In contrast, Evendim’s lake might feel somber but not evil – perhaps gently enchanted by the memory of the elves and Númenóreans who loved it. **Remnants and Fortifications:** As they explore, the group might come across smaller ruins as well: for example, **watch-towers** on hills (Arnor had watch-towers along the Hills of Evendim and the North Downs), **ancient fortifications** like broken walls or forts. One named place is **Sarn Ford** at the Shire’s south border (where the Greenway crosses the Baranduin), but that’s south, not on their route. In the north, names are scant in canon besides Fornost and Annúminas. A map shows features like the **Evendim Hills** west of the lake, and the **Weather Hills** far east (Weathertop, etc., but that’s beyond our scope). **Mount Gram**, the orc-lair Golfimbul came from, lies to the northeast of Fornost in the Ettenmoors; you might mention it if researching where the orcs that troubled the Shire came from. The Shirefolk wouldn’t know Mount Gram, but perhaps a Ranger or dwarf might mention “Goblins from Mount Gram used to raid these parts.” **Hobbit knowledge of Arnor’s Downfall:** Hobbits proper don’t know much about the wars of Arthedain and Angmar – they only remember that “the kings failed and the Shire was on its own.” However, their lore (via Bilbo and the Red Book) notes that Arvedui was the last king who died in the far North (Forochel) and that was essentially the end of the North Kingdom. They might also know a prophecy or two: for example, Gandalf or Bilbo might have recounted Malbeth the Seer’s prophecy about Arvedui (“Arvedui, Last King” is a tale in Appendix A). If not, you as the author can decide how much second-hand knowledge to filter in. It might be more authentic that these young hobbits know *very little*, and thus they ask questions to any sage they meet, letting exposition come naturally. For instance, if they meet a Ranger, he might explain: “This was the great city of Annúminas, where Elendil once dwelt… and there on the green plains the Witch-king’s forces broke the armies of the North.” The hobbits would listen wide-eyed, perhaps connecting the dots: “So *this* is where our folk came to fight alongside the King!” That moment can be a powerful realization for Tolly – standing in the place where his ancestors’ courage was spent. In summary, the **regions of Evendim and Fornost** offer a dramatic change from the Shire: wide open landscapes, ancient ruins, and a palpable sense of history and lost majesty. This will deepen the tone of the story as the hobbits leave behind the familiar. Ensure consistency with Tolkien’s geography: distances are not too great (the entire journey from the Shire to Fornost is on the order of perhaps 150-200 miles), but the psychological distance is enormous – they have stepped into a world where **legends walked**. Use descriptions that echo Tolkien’s style in similar contexts (e.g. how he described the Barrow-downs or Hollin’s ruins) – a mix of melancholy, awe, and a faint hope of renewal. After uncovering whatever truth they find, the return home will be equally important (tying the grand discoveries back to the humble Shire). 

## 4. Elven Rangers and Other Figures 
The wilds of Eriador in the late Third Age are sparsely populated, but not entirely empty. This section addresses the plausibility of encountering an **Elven ranger-like character** and other notable figures during Tolly’s quest. We examine who such an elf might be (origin, motives), as well as consider interactions with the Dúnedain Rangers (Men) and any other beings the hobbits might meet (dwarves, etc.). **Elven “Ranger” – Plausibility and Concept:** Tolkien did not explicitly describe any Elven members of the Dúnedain Rangers. The Rangers of the North were a brotherhood of Men (the descendants of Arnor’s kings). However, Elves and Rangers did cooperate at times. Notably, the sons of Elrond (Elladan and Elrohir) often rode with the Rangers in hunting or warfare during the late Third Age. These two were peredhil (half-elven) but chose to live as Elves for long ages, and they certainly had ranger-like roles. They fought orcs in Eriador and later joined Aragorn’s Grey Company. So there is some precedent for Firstborn individuals acting as rangers (scouts, warriors in the wild). Aside from them, other Elves in Eriador include: **Círdan’s folk** in Lindon (mostly around the Havens) and possibly wandering companies that travel between Lindon and Rivendell. One of these wanderers is **Gildor Inglorion**, whom Frodo meets in 3018 – Gildor is a Noldo noble who leads a small band of Elves through the Shire on their way east (they were possibly heading to Rivendell or just roaming and eventually going to the Sea). Gildor calls himself “of the House of Finrod” and is clearly at home in the wild, camping under the stars. So yes, an Elf comfortable with wandering Eriador does exist in canon. Given this, introducing an Elf character in the Tower Hills/Lake Evendim area is feasible. Here are a few logically consistent backstories for such a character: 
* **A Lindon Elf Warden:** Perhaps an Elf sent by Círdan to mind the Tower Hills or scout eastern Eriador. This elf might be a Sindarin or Noldorin elf who remained in Middle-earth. His (or her) **affiliation** could be loosely with the *Guardians of Emyn Beraid* – an unofficial title, since Círdan’s folk likely keep an eye on those palantír towers. Motivation: ensuring no evil creatures or treasure-hunters disturb the palantír in Elostirion, and keeping track of any shadow of Angmar stirring again. By T.A. 3000, the Shadow is rising in Mirkwood and Dol Guldur, which might prompt elves to be a bit more vigilant even in the west. An elf of this kind might have noticed unusual orc movements or sensed a darkness around Fornost and thus be investigating – meaning he could cross paths with the hobbits in the ruins, possibly saving them from a wight or orc.
* **A Noldorin Scholar/ Ranger from Rivendell:** Elrond occasionally sends his people abroad for knowledge-gathering or messages. Perhaps an elf from Rivendell is visiting Eriador’s old sites, either to gather remaining artifacts of the lost kingdom or out of nostalgia (some of Elrond’s household have memories of Gil-galad’s alliance with Arnor). Motivations could include ensuring that the tombs of the Kings (if any near Fornost) are not despoiled, or looking for clues about the enemy. (In *Unfinished Tales*, it’s mentioned that Elrond knew the Witch-king was moving again around 3018 and advised Aragorn and Gandalf. Some scouting may have preceded this knowledge.) Such an elf might be less warrior, more lore-master, but still skilled with sword and bow as all Elves are. This would give an opportunity for a wise, ancient perspective character to relay history to the hobbits.
* **A Silvan Elf far from home:** Less likely but not impossible: perhaps a Silvan elf of Mirkwood or Lórien on an errand. For example, after Gollum’s escape in 3018, some Mirkwood elves searched western lands (though they likely went south, not as far as Evendim). Or, conceptually, an elf who simply felt drawn to see the sea (some Silvan elves eventually hearken to the sea-longing). On their way west to Lindon, they could pass via Evendim out of curiosity (especially if they are skilled hunters tracking orcs). But unless tied to a known event, this might feel random. It’s safer to use Lindon or Rivendell elves since those are established in Eriador. **Characteristics of an Elf Ranger:** He or she would be notably tall, graceful, and far more experienced in the wild than the hobbits. They could travel with minimal gear (Elves can sleep under stars, find food on the go, and move swiftly). If one joins the hobbits, it might be temporary – perhaps guiding them from the Tower Hills to the lake, or rescuing them at a critical moment. Cultural interplay would be interesting: Hobbits are earthy and informal, Elves are ancient and carry a subtle magic or awe. Yet Tolkien often showed Elves being kind and even merry with the right companions (Gildor’s company was friendly to Frodo, giving advice and food). The elf might speak Westron (Common Speech) because any elf dealing with other races usually does, but could occasionally slip into Sindarin. The hobbits might not understand those moments, which can add authenticity (maybe the elf sings a lament in Sindarin when viewing Annúminas, which mystifies the hobbits but conveys emotion). **Logical Motivations:** Why would an Elf involve themselves with three hobbits? A few plausible reasons: - **Curiosity and Counsel:** Elves like Gildor took an interest in Frodo’s journey at least to give counsel, even if they didn’t fully join. An elf might find it remarkable that hobbits are seeking knowledge of ancient events – a very out-of-character thing for Shirefolk. He might see in them something Gandalf saw in Bilbo: the small hands moving the wheels of fate. At the least, he could ensure they don’t come to harm in places like Fornost, which he knows can be dangerous. - **Duty:** If the elf is a warden of the Emyn Beraid, he may feel responsible to watch over any mortals in the area. Perhaps he initially shadows the party to make sure they aren’t looters or servants of Sauron (unlikely, but an elf would be cautious). Once he determines they’re innocent, he might reveal himself, offering guidance. - **Shared Goal:** It could be that this elf is *also* quietly searching for something related to the lost Arnor history – for instance, looking for a lost **artifact** or message left by the Kings. If we tie into the lost hobbit archers, maybe some of those hobbits carried a banner or a token from the Shire to give the King, and it got lost at Fornost. An elf who remembers the old alliance might be looking for that lost token (this is speculative, but it gives a reason to team up). - **Foresight:** Elves sometimes have a sense of fate. He might feel that he was *meant* to meet these hobbits – perhaps he dreamt of small hands finding something great in the ruins, etc. This would align with Tolkien’s theme of providence. **Cultural Interactions (Elf–Hobbit):** The meeting of Elves and Hobbits is touching on both sides. Hobbits will be at first shy and awestruck – they may recall lines like *“the stars shine on our meeting”* (Frodo greeted Gildor with a Sindarin phrase, to Gildor’s delight). Perhaps one of the hobbits tries to be polite using a fragment of Elvish or a formal style. The elf, on the other hand, might find them endearing. He might gently tease them or impart some wisdom. A relevant example: Gildor in *Fellowship* calls Frodo “Elf-friend” and refuses to fully explain the danger pursuing them, in a somewhat mischievous but protective way. An elf in your story could have a similar aloof kindness – helping but not simply solving everything for the hobbits. This keeps the hobbits as protagonists rather than sidekicks. Also, consider the elf’s perspective: He has seen ages of history. To him, the tale of the hobbit archers of Fornost might be like something that happened “yesterday” in his long life – or he heard it from his father. Elves have very good memories. So an elf character could actually **confirm the legend**: e.g. “Yes, I recall seeing a band of halflings archers in green, marching with Aranarth’s men after the battle, guarding the camp at night” or something. This would be a goosebumps moment for Tolly – hearing an eyewitness account validating his quest. (Be cautious to keep things credible: if the elf was in Lindon or Rivendell at the time, he might have heard second-hand rather than seen it himself.) **Other Figures – Rangers of the North:** Aside from Elves, the most likely human characters to appear are the **Dúnedain Rangers**. The Rangers are the direct heirs of the lost kingdom, and some operate in these very regions. Fornost is definitely known to them. Aragorn himself, as Chieftain of the Dúnedain, has traveled all over Eriador. In T.A. 3000-3018, he’s often abroad (in Rohan, Gondor, or scouting for Gollum), so it’s not likely he’d randomly appear at Fornost when the hobbits do. However, other Rangers like **Halbarad** or a few unnamed ones could be around. They might initially be suspicious of three hobbits poking in Fornost – for instance, a Ranger sentinel could confront them, thinking they might be tomb-robbers or simply in danger from trolls. Once the hobbits explain their purpose, a Ranger would be respectful; the Dúnedain have a protective attitude toward hobbits (whom they view as under their guardianship, even if the Shire-folk don’t know it). A Ranger could provide key information from the Mannish perspective: e.g., telling the detailed tale of the Battle of Fornost, or leading them to a specific spot (perhaps a **burial mound of fallen Arnorians** where, who knows, a hobbit arrowhead might be found in the earth). Rangers are typically grim, weather-worn, and few in number. They speak Westron with an archaic accent and have some Elvish knowledge (many of them have spent time in Rivendell). So a dialogue between a Ranger and an Elf in front of hobbits might occur, which could be intriguing (the hobbits hearing bits of Quenya or Sindarin as they converse). A Ranger character can also reinforce the theme of the **return of the King**. He might say something cryptic like, “There will be a day when our King comes back, and he will remember what you have done – even the small hands that preserved the memory of loyalty.” That kind of line foreshadows the Restoration, though the hobbits themselves wouldn’t fully grasp it yet. **Other Possible Encounters:** - **Dwarves:** The Blue Mountains (Ered Luin) are to the west beyond Lindon. Dwarves do travel through Eriador; for example, a dwarf could be prospecting old Arnorian ruins for treasure. LOTRO in Evendim region even has a dwarf presence (though that’s not in Tolkien’s text). If needed, a dwarf could be a minor character – maybe the hobbits meet one at Bree or a dwarf camped by the road who warns them of trolls. But since the focus is Rangers and Elves, a dwarf is optional. - **Barrow-wight or Spirit:** If the story leans into the supernatural, encountering a barrow-wight in Fornost’s graveyards is possible. But in canon, barrow-wights specifically haunted the downs of Cardolan (the Barrow-downs near Tom Bombadil’s country) rather than Fornost. Gandalf implies Fornost itself isn’t cursed, just feared by people out of ignorance. So perhaps avoid actual ghosts in Fornost to stay truer to Tolkien’s placement of such phenomena. Illusions of fear or a chilling presence would suffice to explain the “haunted” reputation. - **Evil Men or Orcs:** By 3000, there isn’t an active orc stronghold in Evendim or Fornost. Angmar’s power has not returned (the Witch-king is in Mordor preparing for war, though he does send Nazgûl to the Shire in 3018). Some roving orcs from the Misty Mountains might occasionally stray this far, but it’s quite west for them. That said, if you want a skirmish, a small band of orcs or brigands could appear, maybe remnants turned bandits. Since LOTRO includes tomb-robbers and orcs in Evendim for gameplay, one can borrow that idea *cautiously*. Just ensure any combat feels like a minor incident, not a large battle, as that would conflict with the known peace of the time. **Elf vs. Hobbit Cultural Notes:** On language: Hobbits speak the Common Tongue (Westron) which is rendered as English by Tolkien. Elves speak their own languages but also use Westron when needed. Tolkien often had Elves sprinkle phrases like “Elen síla lúmenn’ omentielvo” (A star shines on the hour of our meeting) when meeting Frodo. Our hobbits likely do *not* know any Elvish, unless one is unusually learned (maybe the Michel Delving hobbit read Bilbo’s translations and picked up a word or two). This can be a charming element: the hobbits perhaps try to address the Elf formally and stumble, and the Elf laughs kindly and switches to Westron, “Fear not, I understand your tongue, friends.” The Elf might even give them nicknames in Elven (like calling one “Perian” meaning halfling, or some affectionate term). Additionally, Elves have a different sense of time – they might reminisce in long spans (“I recall when this oak was a sapling, before the war that slew your King’s great-grandsire…” etc.), which could fascinate or perplex the hobbits. This contrast can provide light humor or deep pathos. **Conclusion of Section:** Including an Elf ranger figure can enhance the story’s depth by linking the rustic Shire folk to the ancient, noble perspectives of Elves. It must be handled carefully to remain plausible: keep the Elf’s presence justified by duty or fate, and maintain the mystique (Elves shouldn’t overshare all knowledge or solve problems too easily). By interacting with an Elf and possibly a Ranger of the North, Tolly and his friends cross paths with the **greater currents of Middle-earth** – the very thing most hobbits never do. This will underscore the significance of their quest. The **cultural exchange** (sharing stories by a campfire, elf-lore vs hobbit-lore, maybe trading a recipe for a song) can also add warmth amidst the adventure. In Tolkien’s world, such meetings often signify hope and the passing on of wisdom, which could be a beautiful element to include in your novella. 

## 5. The Lost Regiment of Hobbit Archers 
At the heart of Tolly’s quest is the mystery of the **hobbit archers who marched to fight alongside the Dúnedain** in the war against Angmar. This section compiles what is **canonically known** about these archers (which is scant, but significant), and then explores **plausible theories and expansions** to build a rich story around them. We will distinguish clearly between Tolkien’s text and later extrapolations or fan ideas. **Canonical References:** The primary reference to hobbit archers in Arnor’s wars comes from an annotation in Appendix A (or the Prologue) of *The Lord of the Rings*. It states: *During the final struggle against Angmar at the Battle of Fornost (T.A. 1975), the Hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to aid the King, but this is nowhere else recorded*. This single line is the seed of the entire legend. It tells us: - The hobbits *did* have a tradition that some of their own fought in that climactic battle. - Official chronicles of Men do not mention them – meaning they were likely few or their contribution modest. - It was specifically **archers** – implying hobbits armed with bows (likely their weapon of choice given their stature and skills). Additionally, the aftermath: “After the battle, the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, and in the absence of the king, the hobbits elected a Thain”. This gives context: the Shire became isolated right after. So if hobbit archers went to battle, any survivors might have returned to a Shire now on its own, or perhaps they never returned at all. It’s conceivable some died in battle, others in the harsh journey. Hobbit lore might remember them as lost far away. Another indirect canon hint: earlier in Appendix A, it’s noted that in the days of King Argeleb II (who gave the Shire to the hobbits) and his successors, the hobbits were expected to “speed the king’s messengers” and maintain infrastructure. So the Shire was somewhat integrated into the kingdom’s communications. When Angmar’s threat grew, there might have been a call-to-arms sent out. We have no explicit record of King Arvedui sending for Shire aid – indeed, Arthedain was so pressed that likely every able fighter was needed. The hobbits at that time had lived in the Shire for ~373 years, developing their own society but still acknowledging the King. It’s plausible the Thain or the Hobbit militia captain at the time rallied volunteers to fulfill their duty to the King. **Who could have led them?** The first Thain of the Shire, Bucca of the Marish, was appointed in 1979 (after the war). But during 1975, there was likely a *leader of the Shirefolk* (maybe the Holdwine or equivalent) who organized the archers. If Bucca was a respected figure then, perhaps he himself led the archers to Fornost and survived to become Thain. This is speculative, but it would be a neat historical link: Bucca the first Thain might have been one of the archers. Tolkien doesn’t say this explicitly, but he doesn’t rule it out either. If Bucca stayed home to coordinate recovery, maybe someone else led them – possibly from the Took or Oldbuck family. The Oldbucks (later Brandybucks) were at that time the most prominent family (since the Oldbuck clan provided the first Thains pre-Shire and were still influential until they left for Buckland in 2340). So an Oldbuck patriarch could have led a troop. **Size and Fate of the Regiment:** The word “company” of archers suggests perhaps on the order of dozens, not hundreds. Maybe 50 hobbits at most (for comparison, at Bywater in 3019, some 100+ hobbits fought the ruffians, but that was the entire Shire rising. In 1975, they’d send a small token force). These archers likely traveled the Greenway north. It’s a journey of roughly 300+ miles from the Shire to Fornost, quite an undertaking for hobbits. If they left early enough in 1974 when war broke, they might have arrived during the siege or just before the final battle in 1975. What happened at Fornost? The Witch-king’s forces overran the city. Arvedui fled (actually earlier he fled Fornost before its fall, seeking refuge in Forochel). Many of Arthedain’s soldiers were killed or scattered. Eärnur’s relief army from Gondor arrived a year later and with Elves of Lindon won victory *after* Fornost had fallen. So the hobbit archers, if present in 1975, could have been part of a last stand or a rearguard. Possibly they retreated with the remnant of the army toward Forochel or survived until Eärnur’s host cleared the battlefield. However, since no Mannish record mentions them, one could surmise they were assigned a minor role – e.g., guarding the camp, or holding a small flank where their deeds blended in with other archers. The romance of the idea is that they fought bravely but were largely unsung by Men. The hobbits themselves would remember, because even one company lost would have been a big deal to the Shire (imagine a large portion of youth going off and not returning). **Speculative Outcomes:** - Perhaps the entire company perished in battle or the chaotic retreat, which is why they were “lost” to history. Maybe a few survivors straggled back to the Shire with tales, which over generations turned into legend. - Or some were taken under protection by the surviving Dúnedain. Conceivably, a wounded hobbit archer could have been tended by the Rangers and eventually brought home or settled in Bree-land. This could lead to an intriguing speculation: could some Bree-hobbit families be descended from a hobbit who fought at Fornost and later stayed in Bree? (Bree was near the action and did survive the war since Angmar didn’t destroy Bree). - Another theory: after Fornost’s fall, those hobbit archers who lived might have journeyed with Arvedui’s followers to the Blue Mountains or Forochel. Arvedui himself died in Forochel (beyond Evendim to the far north) in 1975. Could a couple of hobbits have been with him on that ice-floe? That’s a dramatic but very sad outcome; also Arvedui’s party was mostly Lossoth (Snowmen of Forochel) and a few Dunedain, no mention of halflings. It’s unlikely any hobbit went that far – they probably would not have left Eriador’s more temperate zones. Given these possibilities, a fan-fiction can choose one as the “truth” that Tolly discovers. Maybe he uncovers a **grave marker** or a bit of chronicle that indicates: *“Here fell the Shire Archers under Hobspruce of Buckland”* (inventing a name) at a certain location of the battlefield. Or he finds **arrowheads** with distinctive Shire-make (as per LOTRO’s idea, which has quests to find hobbit arrowheads in Fornost). This physical evidence could confirm that hobbits indeed participated. **Expansions in Secondary Sources:** - **MERP (Middle-earth Role Playing, I.C.E.)**: Many MERP modules expanded on Arnor and Arthedain. While I don’t have a direct quote, some fan summaries suggest ICE made reference to hobbit units. MERP likely embraced the Appendix hint and might have stated explicitly something like “A small contingent of Hobbit archers from the Shire fought and died at Fornost.” In fandom, it’s accepted enough that even Wikipedia states it as a fact that hobbits sent archers. So you can treat it as a “likely truth” within the legendarium. - **LOTRO (The Lord of the Rings Online):** LOTRO has a whole quest line called “The Forgotten Company” set in Fornost. In it, modern hobbits (in-game characters Bartelot and Penny Took) conduct an archaeological expedition to find proof of the hobbit archers. They indeed find old hobbit arrowheads on the battlefield, validating the tale. LOTRO also mentions a legendary hobbit archer-captain whose weapon might be found as loot. These are gamey implementations, but they show how one can weave the archers into story. LOTRO even placed Oatbarton in the Northfarthing and named its region “Bullroarer’s Sward,” thematically linking hobbit militias. While you shouldn’t treat game events as canon, you can borrow the concept of an archaeological or investigative approach. - **The One Ring RPG:** While TOR materials for Eriador haven’t explicitly (to my knowledge) detailed the hobbit archers, it encourages using such hooks for adventures. A TOR adventure could well involve finding a **memento** like a black feathered arrow or a horn with Dunedain inscriptions gifted to the Shire archers. If any TOR fan content exists, it would probably be in an Eriador module or fan-made scenario referencing “The Company of the Shire” or similar. 
* **Fan Theories:** A common fan theory is that the hobbit archers were led by one of the Shire’s prominent figures (as discussed, possibly Bucca). Some have speculated that a **tomb or memorial** to them might exist in the Shire (though Tolkien never mentions such). Perhaps a grassy mound in the Greenfields or a stone near the Brandywine Bridge. If Tolly heard a scrap of a rhyme or found an old map with “Bowman’s Knoll” marked, that could spark the journey. Another angle: Hobbits love genealogy; what if Tolly discovered in his family records that an ancestor “went north and never returned”? That personal connection would drive him on. Maybe a letter preserved from that time – e.g., an old Took letter that says “we send 30 brave archers with Archer Captain X, may they come safe home.” That could be an impetus and also a clue to the number and names. **Mythic Resonance:** From a myth-making perspective, the lost regiment of hobbits is akin to a folk legend of the Shire, something only briefly noted but emotionally powerful. In the Fourth Age, once King Elessar refounded Annúminas, one could imagine he formally recognized the hobbits’ contribution at last, perhaps placing a carved stone in Annúminas listing the Shire archers among the forces of the West. Sam Gamgee (later Mayor) might have even brought that up to the King. In our time frame, though, it’s still unresolved, a **forgotten act of courage** that Tolly seeks to illuminate. **Integrating into the Novella’s Plot:** Likely, the story will follow the hobbits as they collect pieces: - In the Shire: an initial clue (document in Michel Delving or a tale from an elderly hobbit, maybe an artifact like a broken black arrow kept in a mathom). - In Bree (if they go that way east first or meet someone): possibly an old man in Bree recalling “Tales say some little folk fought with Arvedui. My gran’s gran saw small bowmen musterin’ down the Greenway…” – a hearsay confirmation. - At the Tower Hills: Perhaps an Elf-lord there (maybe even Círdan himself, if one goes that far) could say he remembers seeing the halflings march by toward battle, singing a brave song to keep fear away. - At Lake Evendim/Annúminas: they might find a **shield or helm** with a token of the Shire (for instance, a device like a bundle of arrows or a hare emblem – just imaginings; Tolkien didn’t describe hobbit heraldry, but maybe a token like a blue feather used as fletching only in Shire arrows). - At Fornost: the climax of evidence, maybe a shallow **mass grave** of smaller skeletons identified by their green cloth remnants or Shire-made belt buckles, etc. That could be quite poignant. Perhaps too dark – depending on tone, you might opt for something less morbid like finding one carved initials on a stone where they made camp. - Additionally, if any **writings** survived: a chronicle in Rivendell’s library or in the annals of Gondor. (Appendix A was written by Gondorians based on Northern lore possibly brought by Rangers to Gondor; they omitted the hobbits, but maybe Elrond’s library has a note from a witness like Glorfindel: “the halflings stood their ground as the lines broke.”) Distinguishing canon vs. speculation for the reader is crucial in the research bible. So, to be clear: - **Canon:** Hobbits claim they sent archers to Fornost. This is the factual kernel from Tolkien. - **Reputable expansions:** e.g. LOTRO treats it as true and builds quests around finding proof. This supports the idea but is game lore, not Tolkien’s own. - **Speculative but plausible:** everything about who led them, how many, what became of them is conjecture, but we base it on known history. For example, it’s plausible some hobbits were present at the Battle of Fornost given how close the Shire was and their duty to the King, and plausible they were largely wiped out (hence no record by Men). It’s also plausible the Shire folk of later years only vaguely knew of it – maybe only the Took family kept it in their records, which by TA 3000 might be gathering dust at Great Smials. **Use in Story:** Tolly’s motivation might come from personal or intellectual curiosity (or both). Perhaps he lost his parents young (he’s an orphan) and fantasizes about heroic hobbit ancestors – the lost regiment could symbolize to him a connection to something meaningful. When he finally pieces together the truth, he could bring back a tangible proof or even just a well-verified account to the Shire. Imagine the final chapter: the three adventurers return to the Shire and present the Thain or the Mayor with the recovered **Shire Bowmen’s badge** or a written chronicle they made, thereby restoring that chapter of history to their people. In a way, it mirrors what Tolkien himself often did – having characters preserve knowledge (Bilbo writing There and Back Again, Frodo and Sam writing the Red Book). Tolly’s chronicle of the Lost Archers could become part of the Red Book’s appendices in-universe. One moving touch: If any descendants of those archers still live unaware in the Shire, Tolly could let them know of their forebears’ bravery. Perhaps an old Gamgee or Took learns that his great ancestor wasn’t just “lost in the Fell Year” but died a hero at Fornost. That can bring a sense of closure and pride to the Shire community and show how stories can inspire. It might even influence the Shire’s readiness in 3019 (though that’s outside your story’s immediate scope). In conclusion, the Lost Regiment of Hobbit Archers is a perfect narrative device to tie the Shire to the larger world. By gathering canon scraps and logical conjecture, you can reconstruct their tale: their **existence** (sworn by hobbit tradition), their **journey** (from the Shire to Fornost, likely in late 1974), their **deeds** (fighting in the battle, defending the King’s retreat perhaps), and their **fate** (mostly perish, leaving a legacy that faded to whispers). The story Tolly uncovers will turn a one-line footnote into living history. Document all evidence clearly, so the author in you remembers which parts are from Tolkien (for authenticity) and which are invention (for creative license). As a rule of thumb, grounding the speculation in the tone and facts of Middle-earth (no contradicting known events, and keeping within the realm of the plausible) will ensure the addition feels **Tolkienesque** – as if it could have happened, just unwritten until now. 

## 6. Writing Style and Tolkienesque Consistency 
To convincingly set a fan-fiction novella in Middle-earth, especially one focusing on hobbits, it’s essential to emulate Tolkien’s style and maintain internal consistency with his world. This section covers **naming conventions**, language/dialect details, narrative tone, and other stylistic elements characteristic of Tolkien’s works, particularly those involving hobbit adventures. **Naming Conventions (Hobbits and Others):** Hobbit names in the Shire are presented in English in Tolkien’s text, but he explained that these are “translations” of their actual Westron names, chosen to evoke a similar flavor. Generally, hobbit first names are rustic, old-fashioned English (examples: Samwise, Ted, Marigold, Pippin (really Peregrin), Folco, etc.), and sometimes whimsical (Meriadoc “Merry”, nickname forms like Daisy, Merry, Pippin). Many male names end in *-o* (Uso, Marco, Falco, Hugo) or *-a* (Bilbo, Drogo, Lotho) or are compound words (Everard, Sancho, Tolman). Female names often are flower or gem inspired (Rose, Lily, Pansy, Esmeralda). Hobbit surnames usually come from occupations, places, or descriptive words: e.g. Gamgee (from “Cotton” in Westron, but presented as a known surname in the Shire), Cotton, Maggot, Bracegirdle, Smallburrow, Proudfoot, etc. Some, like Took and Baggins, are unique family names with no direct meaning given (though “Baggins” hints at bags, and in fact Tolkien noted it translated an actual Westron name Labingi). For your story, it’s wise to stick to this pattern. If you create new hobbit characters, give them plausible names like **Tom Pickthorn** or **Sage Hayward** or **Lily Brownlock**, for example. Avoid modern or out-of-place sounding names; even if not everyone catches the nuances, the consistency will be felt. Also, titles like “Old” for the eldest of a family (Old Took) or “Wise” for someone like “Hamfast the Gaffer” are used. For Rangers (Men) and Elves, use established naming styles: Dúnedain have Sindarin names (Aragorn, Halbarad, etc.) or nickname-titles like Strider. Elves have Quenya or Sindarin names (Gildor, Glorfindel, etc.). If you introduce an elf, you might call him something like **“Galanhir”** (an invented Sindarin-style name meaning “tree-loom” for instance) or use a less-known name from Tolkien’s roster (perhaps an elf of Lindon named **Enerdhil** or so). Just ensure any invented names feel like they could appear in *The Silmarillion* appendices – melodic, meaningful, and consistent (not too harsh for Elves, not too fanciful for Men). **Westron and Dialect Quirks:** The dialogue of hobbits in Tolkien’s writing often resembles colloquial rural English speech of the early 20th century. For instance, Hobbits drop their G’s (“fishin’”), use contractions freely (“haven’t, don’t, ’tisn’t”), and have some unique idioms (“I’ve half a mind…”, “so Mr. Frodo is going away, is he?” etc.). The working-class hobbits (Sam Gamgee, the Gaffer, farmer Maggot) speak in a more rustic register: using words like *reckon, lunatic*, and expressions of good sense. Sam says “If I may be so bold” or “Lor bless me!” – old-fashioned exclamations. The Gaffer says things like “That’s what I’ve heard tell” and uses double negatives for emphasis (“there’s no need to go looking for trouble, for trouble will find you soon enough, *I says*”). Including a bit of that flavor will make dialogue authentic. However, don’t overdo phonetic accents; Tolkien wrote dialect subtly, mostly through word choice and grammar rather than heavy misspelling. For example, the Gaffer calls folks “queer” or “crackpot” but you won’t see overly comic dialect like “Oi’ve ’eard as ’ow...”. Each hobbit family can have slight differences: Tooks and Brandybucks, being higher-class and more Fallohide, speak a bit more formally. (Pippin and Merry, for example, speak almost like educated young English gentlemen.) Sam and the Cotton family speak more rustic (Sam says “dunno nothing” at one point). You can mirror this: Tolly the orphan might have a plain, earnest way of speaking; the Michel Delving hobbit could be more bookish and prim in tone if he’s from a town; the Hobbiton friend might be jokey and common-sensical. Elves, when speaking Westron, use a more elevated but still clear style. They often do not use contractions (Gildor says “Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards” rather than “Don’t meddle”). They pepper their speech with poetic phrases or gentle laughter. Also, an elf might occasionally lapse into an exclamation in Sindarin (like “Elbereth Gilthoniel!” if surprised or in reverence of the stars). If your elf character speaks directly to hobbits, he might adapt to simpler language to be understood, but still maintain a certain courtliness. Rangers (Aragorn included) speak somewhat antiquated English – but note that Aragorn can use contractions and casual speech when at ease (he jokes with Gandalf using modern-sounding phrases occasionally, e.g., “You have the luck of being wanted” in Bree). But when he goes into “heritage mode,” he speaks with gravity: “*It is a long way for us to go, and there is time ahead for thought.*” A good rule: in formal or emotional moments, elevate the diction; in friendly banter, allow more relaxed tone but avoid any modern slang or idiom that Tolkien wouldn’t use. For instance, a hobbit wouldn’t say “Okay” (far too modern American) or “Wow”. They’d say “All right” or “My goodness”. **Tolkienesque Narrative Style:** Tolkien’s narrative voice, especially in *The Hobbit* and the early Shire chapters of *LOTR*, is warm, descriptive, and sometimes gently humorous. In a hobbit-centric story, you can afford a light tone in parts. The narrator might even directly address the reader in subtle ways (Tolkien does this in *The Hobbit* often: “You will remember…” or “As I was saying…”). In *LOTR*, the narrator is more distant but still occasionally shows a fond irony with hobbits (e.g., commenting on their love of regular meals in a tongue-in-cheek manner). Key elements to include: - **Descriptive detail of nature:** Tolkien lavishly describes landscapes. The Shire is “full of rich brown earth and leaf, the smell of cut grass, the sound of water.” Try to emulate his approach by using specific sense-impressions. E.g., “The morning sunlight slanted through the young leaves of the trees by the Brandywine, and Tolly felt the dew on his feet as they walked on.” - **Use of song and poetry:** Hobbits often sing, whether from joy or to bolster courage. Consider writing a simple walking song for the hobbits as they set out (in the style of the bath song or the “upon the hearth the fire is red” walking song from *LOTR*). It adds authenticity. Elves certainly sing; maybe the elf character teaches them a short elven hymn. These don’t have to be long, but even a stanza or two in the text shows Tolkienesque flavor. Remember to keep meter and rhyme if possible, as Tolkien’s poems had structure (for instance, hobbit walking songs often have a bouncing anapestic meter: “*We still remember, we who dwell / In this far land beneath the trees*…” etc.). - **Tranquility and sudden danger:** A hallmark of Tolkien’s pacing is a mix of peaceful interludes and sudden peril. For example, the hobbits in *LOTR* will be chatting about mushrooms one minute and confronted with a Black Rider the next. In your story, you might have a cozy campfire scene where the hobbits cook a brace of coneys (rabbits) and tell jokes, followed by a tense scene of, say, wolves encircling them or a haunting noise among ruins. The writing should smoothly transition, maintaining suspense. Tolkien uses a lot of **foreshadowing** (“Little did they know what lay in wait...”) and **atmospheric build-up** (describing how the forest falls silent, or how a chill wind picks up) to signal to the reader that danger approaches. 
* **Perspective:** Most of the time, stick to the hobbits’ perspective (either a close third-person focusing on Tolly, or an omniscient narrator that sympathizes mostly with the hobbits). In *The Hobbit* and *LOTR*, the narrative often filters through the hobbits’ perceptions – e.g., describing an elf as Frodo sees him. This helps maintain the sense of wonder. When describing grand things like Annúminas, it might be effective to describe how *small* the hobbits feel among the ruins. That adds to the epic sense (Tolkien often emphasized hobbits’ smallness in big settings, like the Mines of Moria or the Argonath, to awe the reader).
* **Language consistency:** Certain words and phrases should match Middle-earth’s vocabulary. For example, they wouldn’t use “miles” sometimes Tolkien says “leagues” (1 league ~ 3 miles) for long distances in narration, but hobbits might say miles in dialogue. Time is often given in archaic terms: “fortnight” rather than “two weeks”. They use “Shire-reckoning” for years when among themselves, but since our audience is modern, you can translate dates to Third Age. Avoid modern units like kilometers or modern concepts like “weekend” or “coffee” (hobbits drink tea and ale; coffee isn’t mentioned though it might exist, but play it safe with what’s explicitly mentioned like tea). Also avoid modern idioms like “hit the sack” (say “turn in for the night” instead). If a concept needs expressing, try to phrase it in a way Tolkien might. For example, a modern person might say “this was not in my plans”; a hobbit might say “I hadn’t bargained for this” (Sam’s line). That sort of phrasing sounds more old-world. **Dialectical Differences in Narrative:** When narrating hobbit interactions, it’s okay to use a lighter touch, even humor. Tolkien’s narrator sometimes winks, e.g., describing the Hobbits’ love of food with a bit of gentle fun. But when narrating high events (battles, elf lore), the language becomes lofty and archaic, resembling the style of *The Silmarillion* at times. For instance, compare how the flight to the Ford is written vs. how a Hobbiton party is described. In your story, if you recount the Battle of Fornost via flashback or an elf’s telling, consider shifting into a slightly more elevated tone (longer sentences, more formal diction, maybe some archaic constructions like “thus it was that…”). Then shift back to casual tone when in dialogue with hobbits (“Well, that’s a tale and a half!” a hobbit might respond after hearing it). This juxtaposition can recreate Tolkien’s knack for mixing homely and heroic. **Westron vs. other languages:** Tolkien’s conceit is that everything spoken in the narrative is translated to English from Westron (the Common Tongue). He even “translated” many names (e.g., Samwise = Banazîr in Westron, meaning half-wise). For writing purposes, you don’t need to delve into creating actual Westron terms (unless you want an Easter egg; for example, one could mention that the hobbits call themselves “kuduk” in their own tongue, though in the Shire they’d just say hobbit). It suffices to ensure names and terms feel consistent. If using any non-English terms, they should be actual Tolkien languages (Sindarin, Quenya, Khuzdul for dwarves maybe a word, etc.). For example, if the elf speaks Elvish, you could include a genuine phrase: *“Mae govannen”* (well met) as a greeting, or recite a line of an Elvish song (perhaps a line from the song of Gil-galad or a hymn to Elbereth, which are in *LOTR*). **Meticulous Detailing:** One reason Tolkien’s world feels real is the layer of detail – calendars, measurements, history, poetry, family trees – that underpins the narrative. While you don’t want to bog down the story, having those details consistent in the background is important. The Shire Calendar has different month names (Afteryule, Solmath, Rethe, Astron, Thrimidge, Forelithe, etc.). If you want to be thorough, you can mention dates in Shire terms. E.g., “They left Long Cleeve on the 10th of Halimath (Shire calendar), which would be early September by the King’s Reckoning.” However, if that’s too granular, you might leave it out. But even referencing the proper seasons (e.g., “After Lithe, as the summer turned to autumn…”) can hint at that depth. Similarly, use the weekdays names Tolkien gave if needed (Sterday, Sunday, etc.), though rarely do we see those in narrative. **Visual and Emotional Tone:** Aim for that mix of *faerie* and *realism*. Tolkien’s writing could be lush and fairy-tale-like (in descriptions of elves or ancient lore) and also grounded and believable (in describing hobbit cooking or fatigue or laughter). So when writing, say, an encounter at sunset with the Elves at Tower Hills, indulge in a bit of poetic description: “Their hair glinted like copper against the sinking sun, and their voices as they spoke were musical, as if a harp lay hidden in each word.” Contrast that with hobbit practicalities: “Meanwhile, Tom (the Michel Delving hobbit) could not help but notice his stomach rumbling – elf-company or no, it had been a long while since lunch.” Tolkien frequently uses that sort of juxtaposition (like the elves singing to Elbereth and the hobbits feeling oddly hungry or sleepy even as they are enchanted). **Maintaining Authenticity:** In a fully realized research bible, consistency is key. If you introduce any new element (like a magic item or a custom), double-check it doesn’t contradict Tolkien’s established world. For instance, giving a hobbit a family sword – canonically, very few hobbits had swords (Bilbo’s Sting was a big exception). Hobbits regarded weapons as curios by Bilbo’s time. So if you arm your hobbit characters, consider how they get weapons: probably hunting bows, maybe an old Barrow-downs dagger (if they passed through Tom Bombadil’s area), or make them improvise (stones in a sling, a walking stick used as club). Little touches like that matter. If something seems off, use an existing reference: e.g., hobbits using stones is both authentic and effective (as they are noted to be deadly with thrown stones). Another example: currency. Hobbits use “coins” but we don’t know denominations. In *The Hobbit*, they mention silver pennies. So if needed, say “He paid two silver pennies for the pony hire” rather than inventing “dollars” or such. **Narrative Structure in a Hobbit Adventure:** Typically, a hobbit adventure follows a journey format (there and back again). Make sure to include a clear beginning in the Shire (the comfortable start), an outbound leg where wonder increases, a climactic discovery or event (finding the truth at Fornost, possibly danger to overcome), and then a return home where the Shire is seen with new eyes. Tolkien often has the return mirrored with initial events – e.g., Bilbo’s auction upon return (comic but also poignant), or the Scouring of the Shire (serious and redemptive). In your story maybe the return is peaceful but the hobbits themselves have changed, now carrying a story that enriches their people. The tone on return might be a mix of pride and the bittersweet realization that most folk cannot fully understand what they went through (common in hero’s journey). Pippin and Merry experienced this in LOTR, coming back taller (literally) and more worldly, and having to adjust. To emulate Tolkien’s **voice** during reflective moments, consider using some archaic sentence constructions and narrative commentary. For example, “Thus ends the tale of the Lost Archers – a small deed in great wars, perhaps, yet one not to be forgotten by the Shire again.” This sounds like something from the Red Book. You might incorporate such a line in an epilogue or in the text as the hobbits conclude their quest. **Dialect examples to illustrate style:** - Hobbit rustic speech: *“Begging your pardon, Mr. Tolly, but I reckon it’s going to rain cats and dogs before nightfall,”* said Hob Hayward, squinting at the dark clouds. (Hob Hayward is an actual Shire Bounder character in LOTR, with one line at the gate.) - Elf speech: *“The shadows lengthen in the East. I fear there are tidings of trouble, even here,”* said the elf, and his grey eyes were thoughtful. *“Yet under starlight we may find hope renewed. Do not despair, children of the Shire.”* - A mix in narration: *The hobbits shivered, and drew closer to the small fire. Around them the ruins of Fornost were deathly quiet, as if the stones themselves remembered fear. And yet, as they huddled, Penny Took began to hum a walking-song through chattering teeth – a brave, absurd little tune that brought a smile even to the Ranger’s face.* (This kind of passage shows the blend of ominous setting and indomitable hobbit spirit with a bit of humor at calling the tune “absurd little” – a gently omniscient narrator’s judgment.) Remember, Tolkien’s style can shift from almost biblical (“And lo! the light of Eärendil rose in the West…”) to Hobbit-folksy (“If I’m not mistaken, there’s something mighty queer behind this…”) without jarring the reader, because the context changes. In your story, when focusing on the hobbits alone or in comfy environs, use the simpler, familiar tone. When touching on legend or history (like recounting the battle in dialogue or in documents), edge into the archaic. One trick: use archaic grammar for formal speech – e.g. “Fornost Erain, which in the tongue of men signifies Norbury of the Kings, *was* a mighty fortress of old. There *did* Arvedui make his last stand…” – using inversions and older word order can give a flavor of an old account. **In-world Documents:** If you plan to insert any letters, journal entries, or inscriptions that the characters find, style them appropriately. A letter written by a hobbit Archer in 1974 might read like: *“To my dearest father, I hope this missive finds you. We have reached Kings’ Norbury. The Lord Arvedui himself thanked us for our service. Fear not for me; I stand with stout fellows and our arrows have proven true. If I should not return, know that I did my duty. Your loving son, Polo.”* – See how that is slightly more antiquated than modern, but still simple (a hobbit writing to family). An inscription on a tomb could be in Sindarin (you might craft something with real Sindarin words, or just describe it: “They traced the Elven-script on the stone, spelling out names none of them could read, but the Elf spoke them softly: ‘Here lie those who fell defending Fornost, in the year 1975 of the Third Age…’”). Finally, **dialect and accent tags**: You don’t need to write accents like phonetic Scots or anything. Tolkien’s regional dialects among hobbits are not really explored (though one could imagine Eastfarthing hobbits vs. Westfarthing having slight differences, it’s not documented). So treat all Shire hobbits as one dialect group for simplicity. The Bree-hobbits speak similarly (maybe a tad more rustic, but we only hear one Bree-hobbit talk: e.g., Nob the inn-boy, who is cheerful and simple). If Bree men appear, Tolkien gave Butterbur a very vernacular style (“Nasty weather, ain’t it?” and dropping initial H: “’Ave you ’eard the news?” maybe). Actually, Butterbur says “I’d not have believed it without hearing the words of Gandalf’s own mouth” which is fairly normal English with maybe an idiom “of his own mouth.” So you don’t need to create heavy dialect differences unless you want to differentiate class (like Gaffer vs. Frodo). It’s more about idiom and attitude. In sum, for **Tolkienesque consistency**: immerse yourself in similar chapters of LOTR (the early chapters in the Shire, the Bree scenes, the Rivendell council for high style, and Appendix A for historical voice) and echo those patterns. Keep paragraphs manageable (as you see in this research bible, I’ve tried to break them logically). Tolkien himself wrote some long paragraphs, but in modern writing it’s okay to break up for readability, as long as it doesn’t break the narrative flow. By adhering to these style principles, your novella will *feel* like an organic extension of Middle-earth rather than a modern text set in Middle-earth. Readers should ideally sense the difference only as a matter of authorship, not of world inconsistency. If someone could pick up your story and believe it might have been a lost tale edited out of the Red Book of Westmarch, you’ve succeeded in capturing the Tolkienesque essence. 

## 7. Annotated Bibliography and Source Evaluation 
In crafting this research bible and the eventual story, it’s vital to distinguish between Tolkien’s canon and later additions or interpretations. Below is an annotated list of sources used and recommended, categorized by primary (Tolkien’s own writings) and secondary (post-Tolkien adaptations or scholarship). Each entry notes how it informs the novella and the degree of authority/canon it carries. **Primary Sources (Tolkien’s Works):** 
* **The Hobbit** by J.R.R. Tolkien – *Provides the foundational tone for hobbit adventures and insight into hobbit character.* While set long before our story (2941 T.A.), it introduces the Shire at Bag End and characters like Bilbo and the Took clan. Notably, it contains the folk tale of Bandobras Took and the Battle of Greenfields (in Chapter 1) – establishing that hobbits can show courage and even a sense of humor about it (golf’s invention). The narrative style here is more whimsical and directly addressed to the reader, which can guide the lighter parts of our novella. **Usage:** Use for reference on hobbit perspectives and sprinkle in similar light-hearted narration when appropriate. (Canon)
* **The Lord of the Rings** by J.R.R. Tolkien – *The principal source for late Third Age Shire life, Eriador’s geography, and the tone of a more mature hobbit story.* Key sections include the Prologue “Concerning Hobbits” (which gives a wealth of info on hobbit society, government, and habits), the early chapters in the Shire (“A Long-Expected Party”, “Three is Company”) for Shire atmosphere and dialect, and Book I chapters 9-12 (Concerning Bree and the journey to Weathertop) to understand interactions between hobbits and Rangers/Men. Appendix A (Annals of the Kings and Rulers) – especially the section on Arnor and Angmar – is crucial for the historical background: it mentions the fall of Fornost and contains the line about the hobbit archers. Appendix B (The Tale of Years) provides timeline context (e.g., dates of Angmar War events). **Usage:** Directly cite for factual claims (like the archers at Fornost, the Shire’s founding, etc.). Emulate its language for consistency. (Canon)
* **Unfinished Tales** edited by Christopher Tolkien – *Supplementary narratives that add depth to Arnor’s history and the role of the Rangers.* Relevant parts include “The Disaster of the Gladden Fields” (for insight on Stoors and hobbit origins tangentially), “The Hunt for the Ring” (which describes the Rangers guarding the Shire and the movements of the Black Riders – showing Shire’s strategic importance and Rangers’ vigilance), and maybe snippets about the Palantíri (there is a chapter on the palantíri that might mention Elostirion and the Tower Hills). While UT doesn’t specifically mention hobbit archers, it gives the broader context of the North Kingdom’s end and the continued efforts of the Dúnedain. **Usage:** Use as background knowledge to ensure any references to events like Arvedui’s fate or the palantír of Elostirion are accurate. Direct citation not necessary unless quoting a fact. (Near-canon, since it’s JRRT’s writing, though incomplete.)
* **The Silmarillion** (Akallabêth and Of the Rings of Power) by J.R.R. Tolkien – *For deep background on Arnor and the Second/Third Age history.* The Silmarillion’s section “Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age” gives a concise overview of Arnor’s founding by Elendil, its division, and the wars with Angmar (though in less detail than LOTR Appendices). It establishes the high-level events (Elendil building Annúminas, the line of Isildur, the Witch-king’s identity, etc.). **Usage:** Use as a factual reference to ensure historical accuracy in describing Arnor’s decline, but since it’s an external narration, you might not cite it directly in the fan-fiction narrative (the info mostly overlaps with LOTR Appendices). (Canon)
* **The History of Middle-earth, Volume XII: The Peoples of Middle-earth** (particularly the section “The Appendix on Languages” and notes on Hobbits) – *Optional but insightful.* Here Tolkien (through Christopher’s editing) explains the conceit of translating hobbit names and gives actual Westron names for some (e.g., Maura Labingi for Frodo Baggins). Also, there are notes on the origin of the word “hobbit” (Khuzdul *kuduk* via Rohirric *holbytla*). While not needed for the story, it’s useful in ensuring that any linguistic asides are correct. **Usage:** Only if you want to include meta-linguistic tidbits or ensure a name’s meaning (like Michel Delving meaning “large excavation”). Generally not cited in-story, more for writer’s reference. (Authoritative but posthumously published; use sparingly.)
* **Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien** (selected letters) – Tolkien’s letters often clarify the tone he intended. For instance, Letter 214 to Deborah Webster gives a description of hobbits and their relation to humanity (calling them “rustic English people, made small in size because it reflects the small reach of their imagination, but with potential for sudden growth”) – paraphrased here. Such commentary can guide portrayal of hobbits. Also, Letter 144 (to Naomi Mitchison) touches on details like the mathom-house (stating that Mathom-house had the mithril-coat, etc.). **Usage:** as background advice to yourself. If you need to clarify why hobbits act a certain way, Tolkien’s own words help. Not cited in the novella, but helps ensure authenticity (e.g., understanding that hobbits think of themselves as a branch of humans in a way). (Not primary canon, but direct author commentary.) **Secondary Sources (Expansions, Adaptations, Analyses):** 
* **Tolkien Gateway** (online encyclopedia) – *A comprehensive fan-curated wiki with collated info.* Articles like “Fornost Erain”, “The Shire” etc., summarize canonical facts with citations. It noted for example that Bree-folk called Fornost “Deadmen’s Dike” and Butterbur’s dialogue about it, which we used via a direct quote from LOTR. While TG itself wasn’t directly citable due to access issues, it provided guidance on where in LOTR to find things. **Usage:** As a behind-the-scenes research aid to locate references. (Accuracy good, but always cross-check with the primary text. Not cited directly in our final text except where it duplicates a quote from LOTR.)
* **The Lord of the Rings: A Reader’s Companion** by Hammond & Scull – *Valuable for detailed annotations on LOTR chapters.* (Not explicitly cited above, but recommended.) It often explains historical references, like the archers at Fornost, providing the exact source (Appendix A in this case). It’s a scholarly source that can validate any ambiguous points. **Usage:** Check it if uncertain about a detail, like Shire calendar usage or meaning of a saying. (Secondary, very reputable.)
* **MERP Modules (Iron Crown Enterprises)** – Particularly *“The Shire”* (1987) and *“Angmar”* or *“Lost Realm of Cardolan”* modules. These RPG books expanded geography and lore. For example, *The Shire* module likely adds villages (the Reddit mention showed that Fonstad’s Atlas or MERP assumed a “Sackville” location). The *Angmar* module may dramatize the Battle of Fornost. ICE’s MERP is not canon and sometimes conflicts with later published info, but it’s crafted to fit logically based on what was known in the 1980s. **Usage:** Use for inspiration on filler details (like names of minor villages or possible routes). Be cautious: label anything from MERP as non-canonical. In our document, we mention Sackville as an interpolation and present it as a fan concept. We did not find direct MERP text to cite, but we acknowledge its existence. (Secondary, use with attribution/distinction as we did for Sackville.)
* **The Lord of the Rings Online (LOTRO)** – The MMO game provides a rich depiction of Eriador around T.A. 3018. It notably has content for the Shire and Evendim that aligns with and expands lore. We cited a LOTRO fan blog regarding the **Hobbit archers quest** and how Turbine (LOTRO’s developer) included ruins in the Shire as Arnorian remains. We also pulled info from LOTRO-wiki for Oatbarton. LOTRO is explicitly non-canon, but it often tries to stay plausible. **Usage:** We incorporated LOTRO ideas like archaeologist hobbits finding arrowheads as an example of how the legend can be used – clearly marking it as an in-game event. Also borrowed the existence of Oatbarton and Dwaling (labeling them as game inventions in Section 1). It helps flesh out the world, but we always clarify which elements are game-derived. (Secondary, clearly identified as game adaptation.)
* **The One Ring Roleplaying Game (Cubicle 7/Free League)** – This game’s sourcebooks often adhere closely to canon while adding detail for gameplay. For instance, *The Adventurer’s Guide to Eriador* or *The Shire* source (if any) might provide little hooks about the Rangers or Shire. We did not cite TOR directly because it was not easily accessible in text form here, but we referenced it as a reputable expansion. TOR’s influence is seen in how we treat the tone and minor details (TOR usually emphasizes atmosphere and small lore). **Usage:** Acknowledge as a source of inspiration for expanding ambiguous areas. For example, TOR might have a patron like an Elf or Ranger guiding players, which parallels our Elf Ranger concept (though that concept is also justifiable by LOTR itself). (Secondary, not directly cited but used conceptually.)
* **Fan scholarly blogs and analyses:** e.g., “A Tolkienist’s Perspective” article on Shire’s military, which provided direct quotes from the Prologue about the Shire-muster and weapons. We used that to get the exact wording from FOTR Prologue. Blogs like these are useful to confirm interpretations (like the existence of stored weapons). Also, the Laurelin Archives entry we found gave the verbatim dialogue about “Tree-men” in the Shire. We used that to quote Sam’s story accurately. **Usage:** We carefully cited the actual Tolkien lines as found on those blogs, rather than the bloggers’ commentary (ensuring we capture Tolkien’s words within quotes). These sources help retrieve quotes without the books in hand. (Secondary, content mostly primary quotes though, which we then cite with credit.)
* **The Atlas of Middle-earth** by Karen Fonstad – *Maps and geographic interpretations.* Not directly cited, but we referenced Fonstad’s reasoning about Sackville as gleaned via Reddit. Fonstad’s work is usually considered a valuable secondary reference; she often places unnamed locations logically (like the probable location of the “Sackville” estate based on pipe-weed fields). **Usage:** Indirectly used for distances (we mentioned Shire is 120x150 miles which is likely from Fonstad or the text). Could be used to plan journey distances and logistics realistically. (Secondary, respected but not canon; we treat any Fonstad addition like Sackville as speculation.)
* **Encyclopedia of Arda (online)** – A reference site summarizing many things. We used it to confirm Michel Delving’s translation and status and that the Mathom-house contained weapons. It often matches Tolkien’s text closely. **Usage:** Verified facts like Michel Delving being the chief town (which we then cited from ArdaCraft Wiki that had similar info). (Secondary, generally accurate; we still cross-check if possible.)
* **LotR Wiki (Fandom Wiki)** – Another fan-run compendium. We used it for specifics such as the exact phrasing of Golfimbul’s death and golf invention, as well as details on Golfimbul’s invasion (which noted Rangers were busy in T.A. 2740s, thus letting orcs through). These are cited where relevant. LotR Wiki often incorporates info from multiple sources (books, games, etc.), but the parts we used were directly sourced to Tolkien’s texts in their references. **Usage:** When we needed a detailed account (like the Battle of Greenfields sequence), we used the wiki’s text and citations to ensure we had it right. Also the mention that Rangers were fighting elsewhere in 2740 adds depth to that event (and was footnoted to a source, likely HoME or a note by Tolkien). (Secondary, used carefully with cross-reference, cited to acknowledge source of phrasing.) **Evaluation of Sources:** * **Priority of Canon:** We give Tolkien’s own writings highest priority for shaping plot and details. The story’s skeleton (Shire -> Tower Hills -> Evendim -> Fornost -> return) and key historical points are all drawn from or supported by LOTR text and Appendices. For example, we wouldn’t create a battle in the Shire in 3000 T.A. because canon says Shire was peaceful then; any conflict we add (like wolves or bandits) is minor and plausible within canon. We explicitly cited canonical statements (like Butterbur’s quote about Rangers, or the prologue on hobbit archery skill) to anchor our extrapolations.
* **Use of Reputable Expansions:** MERP, LOTRO, TOR are used to enrich flavor (new place names, quests) but not to override canon. We label them so the author knows these are optional embellishments. For instance, including Oatbarton (from LOTRO) as a stop is a choice – it adds realism that hobbits farm near Evendim, but the story could omit it if one wanted pure canon. By separating in the text (“Notable fan expansions… e.g. Needlehole, Dwaling (LOTRO)”), we allow the author to pick what enhances the narrative without confusing it for Tolkien’s own invention.
* **Speculative Theories:** We proposed theories (like Bucca being one of the archers, survivors’ fate, etc.) clearly as speculation but “grounded” in logical reasoning from canon. Each is couched in tentative language (“perhaps,” “it’s possible that…”). This signals to the author that these are our narrative suggestions, not established fact, so they can adjust as they see fit. We ensured no speculation contradicts canon events. For example, saying some hobbits might have been at Fornost and died there fits the ‘nowhere else recorded’ note; we didn’t, say, claim they killed the Witch-king or something outrageous that would conflict with Glorfindel’s prophecy.
* **Citations and attributions:** Throughout this document, we used the citation format【source†lines】 to tie claims to sources. For canon quotes, this often points to LOTR (via a secondary quoting source). For example, *“they shot well with the bow, for they were keen-eyed”* is directly from FOTR Prologue, cited via the Tolkienist blog. This lends credibility and also lets the author find the full context if needed. For non-canon info, we cited the source as well, making clear if it’s from a game or analysis (e.g., the LOTRO nugget blog for archers, or Reddit/Fonstad for Sackville). This way, the author can evaluate “Do I want to use this element from a game?” and see its origin.
* **Balancing sources in narrative:** When writing the actual story, one wouldn’t cite sources, but this research bible is a reference. By having the citations here, the writer can double-check details in the original materials if desired (like reading Appendix A’s account of Arvedui, or re-reading the Gildor scene for dialogue style). It ensures transparency of information origin. In conclusion, the sources above collectively ensure that every factual element in the novella can be traced to Tolkien’s own world, and every embellishment is in the spirit of that world. The **canonical materials** form the bedrock (Shire culture, history of Arnor, known events), while the **secondary** materials fill in gaps and inspire plausible story arcs (specific locales, quest ideas). By clearly distinguishing them, we maintain authenticity: the final story can lean as heavily or lightly on the non-canon bits as the author prefers, without ever accidentally contradicting Tolkien. The structure of this research bible itself – from locations to cultures to plot devices – is built to give an author everything needed to “write a fully realized Middle-earth novella using only this reference,” as requested, and the annotations ensure trustworthiness and depth of that reference.
