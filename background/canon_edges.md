# Canon Edges & Safety Rails (TA 3017 / SR 1417)

Source of truth: `config.yml` and `checks/style_lint_spec.md`.

## Hard Bans (do not cross)
- Nazgûl on Shire roads — not present in 3017; avoid chases, sightings, or named references.
- Sharkey/ruffians — no occupation or scouring events; those belong later.
- Scouring events — no proto‑scouring; keep peace outwardly intact.
- Overt fireworks visit in 3017 — no public wizardly displays.
- Saruman meddling locally — keep southern rumors oblique; no named interference.

## Offstage Allowed (use lightly)
- Rangers vigilant — quiet watch, courteous, not quest‑dispensers.
- Dwarves trading — small companies on the East Road.
- Greenway traffic — thin trickle of southerners; ambiguous motives.
- Rumors from Bree — newsy, human‑scale, not prophecy.

## Usage Pattern
- When tension is needed, prefer thresholds (gates, bridges, fords), weather, and human misunderstanding.
- If a scene leans epic, recast as rumor, distance, or aftermath. Name less; imply more.
