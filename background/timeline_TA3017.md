# Timeline Anchors — TA 3017 (SR 1417)

Use season markers and allowed time phrases; keep events local and small‑scale.

- Early spring — spring sowing noted across Westfarthing; roads soft; few travelers.
- Mid spring — Dwarves pass on the East Road in twos or threes; Rangers discreet on the Greenway margins.
- Midsummer — fairs quiet; clear evenings; movement by bells for haying crews.
- Late summer — by sundown the lanes are busy with carts; Bounders trade news at stiles.
- After harvest — river mists rise on The Water; footprints linger in damp silt near fords.
- First frost — hedges glitter at first light; southbound vagrants thin out.
- Winter set — Sarn Ford is held and watched; messages pass infrequently, by courtesy, not by token.

Standing constraints
- Rangers vigilant; they keep watch, not court display.
- No Nazgûl on Shire roads; no Sharkey/ruffians; avoid grand battles.

Additional anchors (for scene flavor)
- Spring sowing — Bounders check stiles and posts along Stock Road.
- By bells — Michel Delving posts keep time by bells; messages handed off at the Mathom‑house steps.
- At first light — watchers at Sarn Ford inspect ferrystone marks and gravel bars.
