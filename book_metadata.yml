blurb: |-
  In SR 1417, when the Shire still keeps its quiet habits by bells,
  odd signs begin to gather where the Brandywine shoals thin at Sarn Ford.
  Crows count at dusk. False cairns gleam where no ferryman set them.
  A reed speaks three short notes to ears that are not hobbit ears.

  Tolman “Tolly” Noakes has a pocket notebook and a careful way of
  listening; Maralda Bunce keeps the town’s neat ledgers and ties red
  thread for memory; Tomberic Greenback has river sense and a steady
  hand for a lantern. With the courtesy of the Rangers, they read the
  ford’s old voice—measuring hiss and push, learning reed‑knots and the
  shape of honest water—and discover that someone is trying to write a
  new map against the Shire.

  By bells and without parade they answer: “Lantern low, never still.”
  “No answers to unknown reeds.” “Name little; mark much.” A grey
  pilgrim’s message passes southward: “Keep the watches.” And when a
  fog‑bound skiff tests the wrong bar, the ford holds.

  A quiet tale of small courtesies and steady craft, By Bells at Sarn
  Ford is a Shire prelude to darker days—a story of neighbours who keep
  their lanes, learn the river, and make peace sturdy enough to be worth
  guarding.
