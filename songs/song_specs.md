# Song Specs (agent-usable schemata)

Allowed types
- Hobbit walking/bath songs — anapestic tetrameter/trimeter; rhyme AABB or ABAB; playful, domestic, road-cheer.
- Distant lay fragments — Old-English-like alliterative half-lines; very sparing; no full translations.

Template (schematic only; fill with original content)
- L1: anapestic tetrameter; ends on a concrete noun.
- L2: anapestic tetrameter; domestic verb + place-name.
- L3–L4: trimeter; clinch with rustic proverb/promise.

Meter/Rhyme quick-checks
- Count stresses by ear; aim for rolling cadence; avoid forced archaism.
- Keep ≤1 song per chapter (`song_present: true` in front matter when used).
