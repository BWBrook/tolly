By bells the fog had thinned to rags along the ditch, and the lane by the Hay Gate kept its ordinary sound: a cart’s patient creak somewhere beyond the turn, a dog that believed in duties, the small talk of leaves. The post stood in its place with the board hung dry and the chalk tied to it by string. Tomberic checked the lantern shutter by touch and then set the light on the ground where it made a small puddle that did not quarrel with the dark. Tolly looked to the token at the fork‑crown willow and found the tight turn still true and the loose loop as they had left it.

The elder Bounder stamped his feet once, not from cold but to let his body know the hour. The boy with the chalk watched him and did the same and then tried to look as if he had not. Nathron stood a little back from the gate where his cloak read as brush to anyone not expecting a man. Maralda had her board and square page; the red thread made its small statement.

“Hear the hedge,” the Bounder said to the boy in a voice that did not scold. “There’s the whisper of leaf on leaf; there’s the rub of reed; and there’s the sound a man makes when he tries to borrow either. That last one never quite learns its manners.” He tipped his head. “Listen for the wrong politeness.”

The boy shut his eyes and stood with his hand on the post. The lane had its layers: the long hush of the river too far off to see; the nearer murmur of wind gathering itself and letting itself go; the very near breath of the hedge with small endings and small beginnings in it. He swallowed, and the Bounder, seeing it, smiled into his collar where the boy could not mistake it for laughter.

“By bells,” the Bounder said, comfortable with the countersign as if it had been born in his mouth. “We keep quiet unless the hedge tells us different.”

The cart that had been creaking beyond the bend came on slow, a grey pony with a mind of its own and a wheel that liked the verge too well for safe going. Tomberic walked out into the lane with the lantern held low so that the light lay along the ruts and not up into the fog, and he turned his wrist till the puddle of light showed the ditch’s mouth like a sleepy eye. The pony, seeing sense, edged away from the soft bank; the driver raised his hat and gave a word of thanks that did not travel far. The lantern went down again and the road kept its quiet. The boy watched all this as if it were a trick, then seemed to understand it was only care with a handle on it.

A reed called beyond the hedge: three quick and then a slow, neat enough to be learned but not clever enough to be born of the place. The boy’s head came up. He looked to the Bounder and then to Tomberic, who did no more than set his palm down as a man might calm a good dog.

“By bells,” Tomberic said, as if he were reminding himself of a shopping list. No one moved. The call came a second time and found no playmate. After a little the reeds rubbed together in a way that belonged to weather alone.

“That was the wrong politeness,” the Bounder said, very low. “Real reeds ask the wind’s leave; false ones forget the order of things.” The boy nodded as if he had been shown how to sharpen a knife without wasting steel.

Later a soft knock came from the hollow lane beyond the gate, not on wood quite, more like a stick thinking about making up its mind. The Bounder did not answer it. He rolled the chalk in his fingers and made a dot beside the dusk mark on the rota, then put the chalk back without drawing any more attention to bravery than was healthy. Somewhere a little way off a small creature made the sound hedgehogs make when they wish the world would choose a bed and lie in it. A shape that might have been a man moved where the hedge dips, then chose the far side of choosing and went away.

A man came up the lane with care, hat in hand before he reached the light. He had dust on his cuffs and sleep in the corners of his eyes, the honest kind. He asked for the ford in the way of someone who has been told to ask and hopes to be refused gently. They set him by the little pot and gave him stew, and he warmed his hands on the bowl as if that warmth would carry a short distance into his thoughts. “By day,” Maralda said, “with company if company can be spared. We do not make the river into a trick.”

He said he had come from a cousin’s house where talk had run longer than the candles and he had thought to make the ford by starlight and save himself a walk at sun‑up. He laughed at himself and agreed it was the sort of saving that spends more than it keeps. He ate, and the tightness in his face eased, and, because the stew did not ask for any man’s honour to be measured by a spoon, he decided to want the thing they offered rather than the thing he had been told to want. He would sleep in a hay‑house that had kept travellers before him and cross by bells when the ferrystone spoke plain.

“No names,” Nathron said, and the man nodded, not as if he had been granted a favour but as if a weight had been lifted that he could not have named. He offered to leave a penny for the stew; Tomberic told him a good word for the Bounders would keep better than coin.

Tomberic took a slow turn to the board and back, not to show himself but to show that stillness has a backbone. The boy, who had been hungry for a chase he could not have named, watched and learned that sometimes a gate is kept by patience and not by arms. Nathron, seeing the learning happen, said softly, “Men who hurry to be seen lose more than they find. A watch that can be seen without being counted is the best kind.” The boy did not say he understood; he only set the chalk in its notch and stood a little straighter.

"Refresh the token," Maralda said when the second bell counted. Tolly set the tight turn anew and touched the loose loop without changing it. He showed the boy once how to make the tight turn with his own fingers and then unmade it so the boy could make it again without looking. The knot sat tidy as a small promise. Maralda watched the lesson without a word and gave Tolly the smallest nod a ledger‑minder can spare for good practice. Tolly wrote short: “By bells; calls ignored; soft knock unanswered; one traveller fed, sent by day; lantern low to road only; token refreshed; no pursuit.” He put the slate where steam would not fret it.

Near dawn the hedge changed its sound the way a room does when a sleeping man turns over and means to wake. The fog strips went thin as lace and then were gone. The cart creaked past and gave a friendly rattle at the post. Dew picked out the thorns like a row of tiny lanterns where no man had hung them. A rook crossed low and swore at the morning, then thought better of it and went to find company. The boy yawned and tried to turn it into a cough and failed. The elder Bounder said, “That will do,” and the watch handed itself over cleanly without clever speeches. Tomberic covered the lantern and shouldered his rope. Maralda tied a red sliver on the posted copy to mark the night’s small change of rota. Nathron looked south a last time and seemed satisfied by the river’s plain face.

It had been a small night. Small nights, if a man stacks enough of them, make a long wall. They left the lane as they had found it: hedge kept; gate minded; board hung; chalk tied; token set. The day would see the ford as it always was to folk who had no business for fog or signals, and that was the point.
