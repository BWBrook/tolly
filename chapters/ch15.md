By bells the fog had thinned to rags along the ditch, and the lane by the Hay Gate kept its ordinary sound: a cart’s patient creak somewhere beyond the turn, a dog that believed in duties, the small talk of leaves. The post stood in its place with the board hung dry and the chalk tied to it by string. Tomberic checked the lantern shutter by touch and then set the light on the ground where it made a small puddle that did not quarrel with the dark. Tolly looked to the token at the fork‑crown willow and found the tight turn still true and the loose loop as they had left it.

The elder Bounder stamped his feet once, not from cold but to let his body know the hour. The boy with the chalk watched him and did the same and then tried to look as if he had not. Nathron stood a little back from the gate where his cloak read as brush to anyone not expecting a man. Maralda had her board and square page; the red thread made its small statement.

“By bells,” the Bounder said, comfortable with the countersign as if it had been born in his mouth. “We keep quiet unless the hedge tells us different.”

A reed called beyond the hedge: three quick and then a slow, neat enough to be learned but not clever enough to be born of the place. The boy’s head came up. He looked to the Bounder and then to Tomberic, who did no more than set his palm down as a man might calm a good dog.

“By bells,” Tomberic said, as if he were reminding himself of a shopping list. No one moved. The call came a second time and found no playmate. After a little the reeds rubbed together in a way that belonged to weather alone.

Later a soft knock came from the hollow lane beyond the gate, not on wood quite, more like a stick thinking about making up its mind. The Bounder did not answer it. He rolled the chalk in his fingers and made a dot beside the dusk mark on the rota, then put the chalk back without drawing any more attention to bravery than was healthy.

A man came up the lane with care, hat in hand before he reached the light. He asked for the ford in the way of someone who has been told to ask and hopes to be refused gently. They gave him stew and told him day was the right road; if he needed to cross, there were hours to keep and company to be found when the sun admitted to its work. He ate, and the tightness in his face eased, and he decided to want the thing they offered rather than the thing he had been told to want.

Tomberic took a slow turn to the board and back, not to show himself but to show that stillness has a backbone. The boy, who had been hungry for a chase he could not have named, watched and learned that sometimes a gate is kept by patience and not by arms.

“Refresh the token,” Maralda said when the second bell counted. Tolly set the tight turn anew and touched the loose loop without changing it. He wrote short: “By bells; calls ignored; soft knock unanswered; one traveller fed, sent by day; lantern low to road only; token refreshed; no pursuit.” He put the slate where steam would not fret it.

Near dawn the hedge changed its sound the way a room does when a sleeping man turns over and means to wake. The fog strips went thin as lace and then were gone. The cart creaked past and gave a friendly rattle at the post. The boy yawned and tried to turn it into a cough and failed. The elder Bounder said, “That will do,” and the watch handed itself over cleanly without clever speeches.

It had been a small night. Small nights, if a man stacks enough of them, make a long wall.
