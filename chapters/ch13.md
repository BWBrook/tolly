After harvest the ground holds a friendliness it does not keep in spring: the stubble is short, the paths remember feet, and the air near the water smells faintly of straw gone sweet with damp. They made their fire in the lee of the blind where the willow hides a man from both banks. The flame was low and steady; the pot gave up a quiet steam. Tomberic minded the stew and the shuttered lantern, setting the light on the earth so it would throw no tale over the river. Nathron stood where a watcher can see the ford without seeming to challenge it. Maralda laid her square paper on a board and set out the red thread. Tolly sharpened his pencil and wrote the date by bells.

“We keep our rules even at a fire,” Maralda said, not as a school‑marm but like one who does a job in the order that saves trouble. “Hands shown. No names asked if none are offered. We do not boast of blades. If a man comes near hungry, we feed him first.”

“And we say nothing that is not for him,” Nathron added. “A courtesy is not a confiding.”

For a time there was only the sound of stew ticking and the river’s old breath. Then the reeds gave a small movement that belonged to men and not to otters. A shape stood just beyond the circle of warmth, a man wrapped in a poor cloak with the dark of the bank on it. He did not come on with any swagger. He lifted his empty hands and kept them lifted.

“Evening,” Tomberic said, as one says to a neighbour on a lane. “There’s heat enough if you’d steal a little. Stew as well, though it’s only the sort that minds its manners and stays in the pot.”

The man moved closer by a small step and turned his face so they could see it. He was not old. He had the look of long wet days and little sleep. His boots, where the firelight found them, showed wide nails set in a pattern that would leave prints a Bounder could pick from a dozen.

“I am not asking for your names,” Nathron said, and in saying so he gave ease. “Nor will we put any on you if you have a mind to keep your own.”

“No names,” the man answered. His voice had a flat weariness in it that comes when a man has walked beside fear long enough to be friendly with it. “Only food, if you’ll spare it. And perhaps, to tell a thing, if telling is allowed by your rules.”

"Eat first," Maralda said, and passed him a bowl and a heel of bread. He sat on his heels, careful, the steam working its warmth back into his hands.

When he had eaten a few spoonfuls and taken his breath in better measure, he looked up. “I came from south of the river. I was hired by men who did not wish to be named, who themselves answered to others they called ‘the new masters.’ They paid in coin and in a promise of dry work later, which was a lie. The work was to set stones bright as buttons along a line under the shallows, to cut a reed and tie knots in it according to a pattern, and, when the water sat low, to nudge a mark‑stone so that it would speak different by a finger.”
Maralda glanced at Tolly then, a quick look of approval for the way he had let the man’s breath come right before asking him for any truths worth having.

No one said the word that lived between them for the mark‑stone. If a thing has a name near a ford, you do well not to call it too fondly aloud.

“Knots?” Tolly said, keeping his tone plain. “How tied?”

The man set the bowl down and, with his hands open where all could see, he began to show simple things with the stew string. “One knot only, at the end: attention. Two together: by the bells. A loop left loose: wait on the look. A loop drawn tight: go. The tail tucked back on itself: choose left when the water runs fretted. Two tails set like a fork: choose right.” He did not look up while he tied; his fingers knew the talk better than his tongue did.

Tomberic nodded once. “That is a language we have started to learn.” He did not say from whom. “What of stones?”

“Bright ones, rounded,” the man said. “Not big. A line from the willow’s toes off into the wrong shallows. They are set by day with a child’s game and a pocket; set and set again if hands come along and put them down differently. We learned to press a finger into the top of the little cairn, so we could tell the last hand that touched it.”

Maralda had begun to write, one word at a time, not a stream. “Who reads the knots?” she asked gently.

“Boats,” he said. “Men who do not own them, borrowing river craft that belong to no man present. A horn sometimes when the turn is made. Two notes mostly. Once three. We were told to mark the hours so a skiff would find its way by counting instead of looking.” He took another mouthful as if ashamed of his own words.

“You were told by whom?” Nathron asked, with no edge.

“A fellow with a smooth hand,” the man said. “He made a mark in wax with the flat of it, broad as if it were a shovel. He wore a twine of black and green in his cuff. He said the new masters like tidy numbers and the Shire keeps poor books.” His mouth pulled, not quite a smile. “I have seen poorer books and kinder men than those.”

Maralda looked at Tolly, not to ask a question but to share the thought that both of them had: black and green; broad‑handed wax; ledger talk. She took a small breath and set down only, “broad palm in wax; black‑and‑green thread; smooth hand.”

“Why are you here?” Tomberic asked. “A man does not come to a watch‑fire for the view.”

The man looked toward the river though the ford lay dark. “I am not fit for their sort of tidy. They asked for a thing too neat for me: a nudge on a stone that was not ours to touch, and a counting of a day’s watches as if a river were a clock to be wound by strangers. There was talk of a theft to cover a look. I am not brave. I do not want blood. I walked until the water told me where to stop.” He held out his hands again as if to prove he had come empty.

“There is another reason,” Nathron said, kind and grave. “You are hungry and you are tired of being told to carry numbers that are not yours.”

The man nodded once, quickly.

“We found a packet,” Maralda said after a small pause that let the stew mark time. “Waxed cloth. Plain cord, and another thread of black and green. We did not open it in the fog. We will copy what must be copied and keep the hands whole. If there is a map or a mark‑list in it, it will answer plain questions without any man needing to put names to his fear.”

At that the man reached into his poor cloak very slowly and brought out a scrap half the size of a hand wrapped in greased paper. He held it as a child holds a hot chestnut, shifting it from one finger to the next. “I was told to carry this to the man with the smooth hand, then to wait for a rope at a certain hour. If I gave it to him, I would be given a dry place and a blanket. I have had dry places and blankets before.” He looked down. “I would rather have a good rule and an honest stew.”

“Put it on the board,” Maralda said softly. She added a twist of red thread to the scrap and to the packet both. “Sight first.” She set Tolly’s pencil where his hand could find it without searching, an unnecessary kindness that has a way of keeping courage from leaking out of a man.

Nathron cut the wax with a small knife that looked as if it had cut more leather than meat. Inside lay a thin strip with lines and little dots like beads, and marks that looked like chickens’ tracks until a man let the ford live in his head while he stared. Then the lines sat down where they belonged and the dots made a shape a skiff would be glad to see in fog. A small scrap of twine was pinned there too, not with a needle but by tar gone hard.

“This wants a plain sentence,” Maralda said, already shaping it. “A line of bright stones set to a wrong bar; knots on reed meaning hours and turns; a mark‑stone to be moved by a finger; skiff to count instead of look; horn two notes at turning.” She copied the strip in square hand, no flourish, each dot set where a man who had never seen this ford might lay a boat and think he was clever. Then she folded her copy and tied it with red thread, and the original she wrapped again without touching the ink.

Tolly wrote what paper cannot always hold: the smell of tar, the feel of thin cloth that has seen too much wet, the way a man’s eyes go slack with long watching and then catch at a common kindness as a hand will catch at a rung. But when he came to his ledger lines he kept them short: “After harvest; bank fire by blind. Stranger fed. Confirms knot primer: end=attention; double=bells; loose loop=wait; tight loop=go; tail‑tuck=left; fork=right. Cairn line bright stones; finger press on top. Broad palm in wax; black‑and‑green thread. Packet and scrap copied; originals sealed. No names.”

“What will you do by first light?” Tomberic asked the man, not as a test but as one neighbour to another who has come into a scrape and must come out of it.

“Walk,” he said. “Not on the Greenway. I will keep to hedges until my boots stop talking. I will not blow any reeds I do not own. If a man asks me who feeds me, I will say the Shire kept its pot where anyone decent might ask for a spoon.”

“There is a stile half a mile west where the hedge is kind to tired men,” Nathron said. “Cross there. Keep the river on your left until the dawn makes it brass. There will be no watch past the fork‑crown willow until the second bell; if you are gone by then, you will be your own again. Take nothing that looks tidy and set for your hand.”

The man stood as men stand who remember suddenly that standing is a thing bodies can manage. He set the empty bowl down with care and bowed a little in a manner that did not belong to his clothes. “I am sorry,” he said, and the words broke nothing. “Thank you.”

Tomberic gave him a crust wrapped in a bit of cloth and looked away while it changed hands. No one followed him out of the ring of warmth. The reeds moved once more and settled.

They sat quiet while the pot made its last small talk. Maralda sanded her copy and tied it; she marked both the packet and the scrap with a neat 13 and a red sliver. “Mayor and Mathom-house get their copies,” she said. “Your folk get theirs,” she added, with a look to Nathron. “We keep our words: name little, mark much.”

“And tomorrow,” Tolly said, “we go by bells to the Hay Gate. It is time that ferry rules were plain and posted.”

"Plain words keep fools from cleverness," Tomberic said, and smiled into his cup.
Maralda touched the corner of Tolly’s page with one finger. “Your way of asking left him stronger than he came,” she said, not as praise but as a fact to be kept.

They put the fire down to coals and drew the blind’s brush a little closer for the night. The river’s old breath went on, steady and without favour. A man had eaten and gone; a small plan had lost a tooth; a better rule had begun to take its shape beside a bank that had outlived more plans than men remember. That was a good night’s work, and not a thing to boast over.
