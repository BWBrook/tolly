The road lifted and fell like the back of a sleeping beast, and the fields on either hand were dappled with stubble and late daisies. In the Green Hill Country the lanes run close to the hedges, so that a walker has the company of leaves and the smell of earth, and the views open suddenly—pasture giving to ridge, ridge to a pocket of beech and holly, then another fold of land beyond.

Tolly walked with Tomberic and Maralda in the steady pace that suits a day’s going, not too quick for talk and not so slow as to make a worry of it. Each had a small pack. Tomberic carried his barrow’s rope coiled across a shoulder because rope is a friendly thing that often proves more clever than a plan. Maralda had her satchel with the square papers and the red thread tucked out of sight. Tolly had his notebook, a pencil, and the short twist of coloured twine in a wrap of cloth so it would not fret itself loose.

They had left the barns by bells and turned their faces toward the Green Hills, meaning to take the by‑lanes that keep to the folds and bring a traveller into Tookland by afternoon. The weather held kind; a wind ran lightly over the grass and the crows kept to their own business, counting furrows without troubling honest folk.

“We will not hurry,” Maralda said, “for we carry no message that a man must sleep on the ground to deliver. But we will not dawdle either. It is better to come to a place in good time and learn its habits than to reach it late and wish you had eyes like a cat.”

“I have only the eyes I was given,” Tomberic said cheerfully. “But I can keep my ears tidy. If a reed so much as thinks of singing, it will find me ready.”

“It is not the reeds that think,” Tolly said, “but the men who set them to it.” He said it without heat. The day did not ask for it.

They came to a stile where the lane crossed between two small meadows, and there they sat to take bread and cheese, because food in the open tastes as if it had been grown for the purpose. From the stile the Green Hill Country lay like a sea with slow waves, and on a far fold there was a glimpse of chimneys that might be Tuckborough, and the line of the Great Smials under the grass like a whale well hidden.

“We shall pass by Tookland without ceremony,” Maralda said, “for our errand is not to stir hospitality but to keep to the road. Yet it does a heart good to see the land thick with houses and orchards. It reminds one what gates are for.”

“To keep flocks where they belong,” Tomberic said, “and friends in kindness, and mischief out.”

“And to remind the feet which way is home,” Tolly added.

When the bread was gone and the apples were finished to their pips, Tomberic set a tune to humming, and Tolly, who had been thinking a verse for three fields now, gave it words. They walked again, and the lane took their feet like a well‑worn shoe, while the green banks held their song close and friendly:

> With a pack on our backs and the bell after noon,
> We keep to the green lane and we mark by the moon;
> The hedge is our neighbour, the stile is our friend,
> We follow the fields till the fields make an end.

> We keep to the left where the thorn makes a row,
> We nod to the brook when its waters run slow;
> If whistles would call us, we give them no sign,
> We walk by the bells and we keep to the line.

The verse was not much, but it had a good foot to it, and the road went easier while it was sung. A farmer in a cart waved and smiled and called that it was a proper day for getting somewhere without fuss. They waved back and kept their step.

After noon the ridge lifted more steeply, and they took the rise in silence, saving breath. At the top they could see long, down the country to where the folds lean toward the south and the road, if you follow it far enough, will find the Brandywine and the ford. Clouds made slow shadows; in the distance a hawk hung, a small dark point that said the air was steady.

“What we do first when we reach the ford,” Maralda said, “is listen. There is a way that water keeps a history if you give it quiet. Then we will learn how the Rangers read their lines, and we will not say that our way is better even if the Shire way is dearer to us. We have come to help, not to teach a man his own trade.”

“Learn first, help second,” Tomberic said. “I can keep that in a pocket where it will not shake loose.”

“And write what the pocket forgets,” Tolly said, tapping the notebook.

They passed a field where sheep had left their soft prints in the dust and a shepherd’s pipe sounded a tune with three notes and a turn that made Tolly think of the reed at Bywater. He did not say so. There is no good in sticking the mind’s finger into every old sore to see if it aches. Instead he counted the posts of the hedge for a time and found a small comfort in the even numbers.

Towards Tookland the hedges grew higher and the gates broader, for the Tooks like tidy boundaries and room to turn a cart. A child on a wall watched them go by and asked if they were bound for the great hill. Tomberic said they were bound for a place further than that, but that if the child had a mind to walk, there were blackberries still hidden in the shady corners where the sun does not reach by late afternoon. The child grinned and slid down; a clatter of feet and a small shout went up from the ditch, which told its own tale.

They did not go into Tuckborough, though the lane would have carried them to a neat green with an inn where a man could waste an hour without repenting. They kept to a by‑way that skirted the back of the Great Smials, where the grass on the long hill takes the light as if it had been polished by years of children rolling. The wind had the smell of crushed thyme and sun‑warmed turf.

“There is a comfort in places that have learned to be themselves and need no teaching from anyone,” Maralda said. “If trouble comes, it should find such places standing as they are.”

In the late light the three of them set down their packs for a little while under a hawthorn that grew out of the bank, and shared the last of the bread. Tomberic produced, with a flourish entirely out of proportion to the size of the thing, a small twist of salt and a crumb of cheese he had been saving. “For courage,” he said.

“Courage likes a crust to stand on,” Tolly said. He looked south where the land gentled into distance. Somewhere beyond those folds lay the willow‑holts and the gravel bars and the stone that keeps faith when the water runs low.

“Our aims, so we do not forget them when the business begins,” Maralda said, and she held up a finger for each: “First, to learn the ford’s habits—the shoals, the channels, the ways the wind lays the scum and the crows behave at dusk. Second, to keep the Shire’s courtesy: we name little, we mark much, we leave no more trace than a footprint by morning. Third, to bring back a record plain enough that a Bounder or a Mayor or a child can understand what was done and why.”

“Fourth,” Tomberic added, “to keep stew between the three of us when we can, because thinking goes thin when bellies do.”

“That is not an unwise fourth,” Maralda said gravely, though her eyes were friendly.

They took the road again as the sun turned honey‑coloured on the ridge tops. The crows that had kept to themselves in the morning now made small parliaments on the furrows and rose and settled as if agreeing on ordinary matters. Now and then a pair would wheel and turn the line of a hedge as if following a rule. It may have been nothing but crows being crows. It is often so. But Tolly set a little mark in his mind and in his notebook, no bigger than a fly’s foot, to remember where he had seen it.

Before the light failed they reached a farm lane where a cousin of Tomberic’s worked a yard with neat stacks and a well‑swept path. Hospitality was offered and accepted in the Shire way, which is to say with thanks and without fuss. They sat by the door and told only what was courteous to tell, and heard in return the usual country talk with one or two strands that ran south: a waggon that had gone astray for half a day; a dog that barked twice at nothing and would not be pleased with any man’s answer; a scrap of black and green thread caught in a hedge where no parcel should have been carried.

Maralda put nothing on the table but a proverb and a smile. Tomberic traded news of the Hay Gate for news of the barley price. Tolly, when there was quiet, asked to see the caught thread. It was no more than a hair of colour, too small to argue with. He thanked the farmer and left it where it was.

By candle the three sat a moment with their packs half‑open and the day’s notes spread like playing cards. They said little. There is a time for talk, and there is a time to let talk settle and be the ground on which you will stand in the morning. At last they closed their books and set their things in order and lay down on pallets near the hearth. Outside, the night gathered itself with the sound of a cart somewhere far, and a barred owl called once and then forgot its purpose.

Tolly lay awake a little, counting his breath and the beats between the small household sounds. He did not think of wolves, though there might be some far south, nor of horns, though a man could hear such a thing on a wind if he wished hard enough. He thought of the ferrystone, which he had not yet seen and which felt, even so, like a promise kept by other men before him, set in the water to be faithful when men were not looking. Then sleep came as it does to those who have walked far enough and eaten their bread and kept their notes.
