Mist lay in long stripes over the shoals, and the ford had the listening hush of a place that has kept confidences in the night and is not yet ready to speak them. Tolly stood with Tomberic by the higher edge of the water where a man can see across without stepping into the cold. Maralda came behind with her papers held flat against the morning air. Nathron looked south and did not hurry the day.

“The river has had another of its quiet works,” he said at last. “We will see what men and beasts have had of theirs.”

They walked down to the shelf below the blind and set their eyes across the ford to the south bank. There the willows grow lower, and the land pulls back to a strip of reed and bare shore. On a tongue of wet sand, dark with night water, a pattern showed as the light came level: four pads and a fifth print like a small thumb set off to one side; long; the nails pressed; the stride a hand broader than a shepherd’s dog would ever make.

“Wolves,” Tomberic said under his breath.

“Wolves,” Nathron agreed. He narrowed his eyes. “One at least with a heavier head. The mark lies deep under the toe. That can be an old dog with a bad habit; it can be something worse. Either way, they have not crossed.”

Tolly had the sense of a line drawn like a gate in air across the water. The ford itself stood for that line: a strip where men had kept manners longer than any of them could remember. He set his pencil down and counted the paces in his head from the ferrystone to the prints, though his paces would not cross them. Counting settled the mind.

“There,” Maralda said quietly, “on the margin of the tongue. A scuff as from a dragged thing and a feather’s mark.”

It was no more than a goose‑feather caught on the edge of weed, black and grey, but it lay near a place where the wet had a colour that did not belong to river water at dawn. There was no drama in it; there seldom is in sign read rightly. Nathron looked and let his breath out once.

“A kill across the night,” he said. “Not on our side; not our flocks. Crows will know already. Men will know before noon.”

He did not call for any horn or haste. Instead he brought from his cloak a length of twine and showed Tolly a knot that was not on the reed primer: a small, tight turn set back upon itself that meant “double the watch by dawn and dusk”. Tolly made it, then unmade it, then made it again without looking at his hands. He would tie it later at the fork‑crown willow.

The light rose. On the south bank the prints ran in a half‑circle where a cautious beast will test the smell of a place, then broke into a stride that led away along the reeds. One print lay larger than the others, long and deep at the toe. Tolly did not name it with any name that boys like to trade round a hedge. He wrote only: “one great print among wolves; may be only weight; may be worse; still beyond.”

They went along the ford’s edge to where the shoals thin and the water makes little cards of light on the sand. Here a faint sound came up the river, hardly more than the memory of a sound: a man’s voice carried and caught, not the common talk of a labourer starting late, but a line half‑sung and half‑spoken, with a weight of old words and weather in it. Tolly felt the hair lift on his arms as if the dawn had turned colder.

It was not much, no more than four lines broken to the breath, and they only heard them because the wind was kind and the singer had not meant to sing loud:

> Over reed and river the watch is kept;
> Wolves on the wold are by warning met;
> Quiet at the crossing, the counted hours;
> Stones keep the story when speech has no power.

The voice fell away. Tolly looked at Nathron, who gave the smallest nod a man can give and still mean yes.

“A comrade to the south,” he said. “He minds his edge as we mind ours. Carry the sound as you would carry a proverb: use it when it fits; do not borrow it for songs at a fire.”

They turned back to their own work. The reed bundles below the blind had shifted since yesterday; two were gone; one had been tied again carelessly so that the loop spoke nothing. The bright cairn‑stones on the upper bar still lay where they had, patient in their wrong. The ferrystone’s voice was lower by a finger, and that, more than any knot or print, pressed a little weight into the day.

“Time,” Maralda said, not as a scold but as a measuring. “Men who count from afar grow bold when the river grows easy. They will try their shoals when the water sits flatter.”

“Then we will sit flatter still,” Tomberic said, “and make our figures shorter. No long tales; only the numbers that let a neighbour see what we saw.”

They ate a bite by the blind: bread and a piece of dried apple. While they ate, three crows came down to the south bank and stepped round the prints in a way that made Tolly think of men in a market, each wanting his share and each pretending, for a moment, to be above such wants. The birds lifted away together and went east.

“Tell the Bounders by bells,” Nathron said, “that our day watches double at dawn and dusk until the river tells another tale. Tell them also that we will not answer any reed unless we can name the mouth that blew it.”

“We can carry that,” Tolly said. He tied the small, tight turn he had learned and set it in his pocket as if it were a real thing and not a trick of cord.

After a last round for changes (none, save for one smear of tar turned dull where the water had washed it thin), they stood a moment without talk. It is good for three people to learn to stand quiet together without any of them thinking the others are idle.

“We have what we came for this morning,” Maralda said. “Wolf‑sign across; river lower by a hair; knots untrustworthy; cairn‑line patient in its wrong. We will say no more to ourselves than that, and we will say only what is needful to those who must hear.”

They left by the path that climbs toward the old stile. At the fork‑crown willow Tolly set the split stick and tied the small, tight turn. He added, below it, a plain loop, loose enough to mean “wait on the look,” because the river had asked for waiting more than for running. Then he stepped back and looked once at the ford and once at the south bank, and let the picture fix itself in his head where stone and water live longer than talk.

Back at the watch‑house, the kettle grumbled. Tolly wrote the morning in a few lines: “Across the ford: wolves; one larger print; kill‑sign old. Ferrystone voice lower. Two reed bundles gone; one retied to no sense. Bright cairns unmoved. Token set: watch doubled at dawn and dusk; wait on the look.” He put the paper under a slate and set the slate where steam would not fret it.

Tomberic mended a strap that had thought to part company with its buckle. Maralda tied her packet with red thread. Nathron stood at the door and looked south for a time that could have been a minute or could have been ten, and then he looked at them and smiled the way a man smiles when three small tasks have been done cleanly and there is nothing clever left to spoil them.

“Keep the watches,” he said. “We will do likewise.”
