By bells the sheds of Longbottom were waking to their business. The air in the Southfarthing has a leaf‑smell after harvest that sits close to the ground, rich and a little sharp, and the barns there are set with wide doors and low windows to keep the wind where it ought to be. Men and women in plain coats moved quietly, stacking and sorting, and there was that kindly clatter of useful work which is better than music when a day is young.

Tolly and Maralda came along the lane with their cloaks folded over their arms, for the sun had already taken hold. It had been a day to the west and a day again to the south since the Hay Gate, and in Michel Delving the note had found its way cleanly from pocket to hand. There had been no fuss about it. Maralda had listened more than spoken, as was her way, and then said only: “Let us look at the hands that write, and at the strings that bind.” So they had set out, taking the road by bells, and now stood at the barn paling while a steward counted bales and a boy chalked figures on a board.

“Good day to you,” Maralda said, when the count paused. “We are not here to meddle nor to buy. We are keeping a small tally of our own and would be beholden for a look at yours.”

The steward had the broad, even manner of a Shire man whose work is taken seriously and who knows the neighbours by name and habit. He was careful, and careful men are sometimes glad to show their carefulness. He made them welcome to the office shed, where a table stood under the window and the ledger lay with a smooth stone upon its half‑turned page.

It was a tidy book. Maralda ran a finger down the lines without touching the ink, and Tolly read with her, saying nothing. The clerk here wrote a small, round hand, patient and legible, the sort of hand that remembers last year while it sets down today. Tolly liked a room where paper lay quiet and in order; such places steady the breath without asking. On the open page were the usual honest things: farm names, weights, and marks for weather and waggon.

“If you will allow,” said Maralda, “we would turn back a fortnight.”

“Allow, and welcome,” said the steward. “There’s pride in neat pages, and no harm in more eyes so long as they belong to friends.”

They turned back together. It is a pleasant feeling to read where work has gone well and numbers sit straight. Then, at the third page, Maralda’s finger rested, and she looked at Tolly without turning her head; it was the sort of look two careful readers share when a line asks for a better answer. He matched her quiet, liking how her silence opened other mouths. In the margin beside three entries, a small space had been left, and in that space the clerk had copied a sign: a broad‑handed seal impression and a twist of black and green indicated by two neat strokes of the pen and a note: “foreign buyer’s string.”

“We had thought that curious,” the steward admitted, when Maralda asked nothing but waited for him to speak. “A new party sent by a friend of a friend, so we were told. We do not sell leaf to strangers, not out of the barns and not on a casual day. But there are bales that are traded between folk we know, and sometimes a sign travels further than a man, for a season, when the roads are unsettled.”

“And the hand that wrote the sign?” Maralda said softly.

“Our own clerk copied it,” said the steward, “for the comfort of memory. The seal itself came and went upon the string. The lots went lawful from our shed to a regular name. We do not alter our ways on account of knots, but we do take notice.”

“So do we,” Tolly said, and took from his pocket the short length of coloured twine he had fished from The Water. He set it on the table, and it looked small there, hardly worth the talk of it. The steward’s eyes sharpened, all the same.

“That is the string of which I spoke,” he said. “Or its twin.”

“There is no need to name the man who carried it,” Maralda said. “If the leaf went by a regular road, and the measure was honest, the matter is not of names but of ways. Has there been any word, beyond the usual, of wagons halted, or questions asked at odd hours?”

“There is talk on the Greenway,” the steward allowed, “but Longbottom does not trade by that path. We send west or north within the bounds, and the rest is other folk’s risk. Still and all, twice in a week a fellow I did not know came to ask when our bells were kept and whether any ferry south ran after dusk. He did not speak ill; he spoke too smooth.”

Maralda nodded and turned the pages forward again, until she stood at the day’s line. “We shall keep our own little list, with your leave,” she said, and at his nod she took from her satchel a square of paper and a pencil, and copied the three occurrences of the seal‑mark, their dates, the weight of the lots, and the name of the regular buyer whose men had taken them.

"We will not copy the name," she added, before the steward had time to draw breath. “We remember it. The paper will go to the Mathom-house, and names there are written only when they must be.”

“That is well,” said the steward. “A barn can do its work more peaceably when names are kept like tools: taken out for the job and put away sharp.”

They left the office and walked the length of the sheds. Here and there a bale lay open, not to tempt a thief but to let the air through for an hour. The cords were plain brown, as a rule, and the knots were the kind a man can tie in the dark without counting. On a bench by the door a coil of cord sat half‑used. Tolly touched it with a finger and thought of the coloured twist in his pocket; his finger came away clean with tar from the other chapter of his mind, where the Hay Gate and the Ranger’s talk lay side by side.

“We shall go now and not trouble your routine,” Maralda said. “If a fellow with easy talk calls again, you might tell him that the bells are kept at their hours, and that lanterns are trimmed low at the hedges.”

“He will hear that,” said the steward. “And perhaps he will hear also that the Bounders are of a mind with the Rangers this year.”

They went down the lane between sheds and pasture until Longbottom lay behind them like a low, well‑swept hearth, and the road turned toward the Brandywine. The day was warm without weight; there were bees on the hedge and a dog asleep in a patch of shade. It would have been easy to forget the coloured twine in Tolly’s pocket and the tallies in Maralda’s hand. Yet there is a way that things gather when a year is turning: small marks line up as surely as waggon‑ruts, and the mind, if it is honest, cannot help but follow them.

“The hand that copied the seal,” Tolly said after a while, “was not the same as the hand that wrote the lines. It was closer‑set, and the strokes fall a little forward.”

“You have better eyes than I thought, or better memory,” said Maralda. “Yes. The clerk made a neat model of another man’s press. And the note he added—‘foreign buyer’s string’—that word ‘foreign’ sits oddly in his usual run. It is not a word he writes often. He thinks it when he must, not when he is idle.”

“Do you think the regular buyer knows he carries another man’s sign?”

“I think the regular buyer knows what he must to keep his wagons going and his promises kept. If another hand leans upon his trade, he will feel the weight before he names it. That is often the way.”

They sat a little while on a stile and ate what they had brought: bread and a sliver of cheese, apples from a hedge‑tree that Tolly had shaken with a stick, and a handful of nuts. Maralda made a small packet of the copied tallies and bound them with red thread: the mark the Mathom-house used for “to be saved,” and put them where the fold of her satchel would hide the colour. Tolly took out his notebook and set down only what could be trusted to paper: three dates; three bales; the twist of string; a man’s smooth questions about bells and ferries; the look of the steward’s eyes when the twine lay on the table. It pleased him that her red thread and his pencil kept the same sort of order without fuss or flourish.

“There is a thing I do not like,” he said, not to spoil the food but because the thought would keep knocking. “The seal itself did not stay; only the clerk’s copy of it. That is another kind of not naming.”

“Yes,” said Maralda. “But it leaves a shape in the mind, and shapes in the mind are sometimes safer than names on a page. If there is a hand behind this, it will write again; men who like tidy marks cannot bear to leave none.”

When they went on, the lane fell a little toward a low place where water stands in winter and rushes take hold by summer’s end. There, where a cartwheel had gouged the mud some days past, Tolly saw a faint print of a boot with nails set wider than a Shire cobbler would place them. It was old, already softening, and might have been a waggoner from out of the bounds who had come north on an honest errand. He noted it without speech and went on.

By bells they came to a small copse where a side path ran down toward a narrow meadow and the river beyond the folds of land. There were traces of feet along that path, light and careful, more than a day old. At the edge of the copse, where a man might stand out of sight and yet look toward the sheds, a low stone had been set up at some time past to prop a gate that was no longer there. On that stone, in a notch the size of a thumb, a crumb of tar had lodged. Tolly touched it and took it between finger and thumb. It stained like smoke.

“We carry fire with us, without knowing it,” he said. “It leaves marks in unlikely places.”

Maralda looked at the small stain as if it were a letter in a strange tongue. “And the river carries what is set upon it,” she said. “Let us keep our bells and our low lights, and give this to men whose task is to stand where we ought not.”

“Nathron,” Tolly agreed. “And the Hay Gate, for courtesy’s sake.”

"And the Mathom-house," said Maralda, "for memory’s."

They turned back then, not to chase shadows but to keep the day’s promises. When they came again to the steward’s door, Maralda asked for a clean scrap and set down one line for his board: “If you see coloured cord or a seal not your own, leave the knot uncut and send word by bells.” The steward read it and hung it beside the chalked weights with a pin. He did not ask for names; he nodded as a man nods when a proverb proves itself under his hand.

By the time the sun leaned west, they were on the lane again, and Longbottom’s sheds were growing quiet in their orderly way. The bells of the farmsteads answered one another with their small iron voices. Tolly walked more slowly than he had come, because the mind walks slower when it carries more than it set out with, and because a day well‑used ought not to be hurried into the next.
