At first light a pale chill lay on the gravel, and the ford seemed to have slept and woken with a thought it had not finished. The ferrystone showed dark in the middle reach; its whisper lay lower than yesterday by a little, as if the wind had been talking to it in the night and they had reached an agreement. Tolly stood with the water at his boots and watched the thin lace over the shallows beyond the stone.

“We will not move it,” Nathron said quietly, as if answering something Tolly had not said aloud. “But we will learn whether another hand has tried.”

They set their sights on the notches that Tolly had marked on the bank to keep his eye honest, then walked down to the edge where a man can test without making a fool of himself. Tomberic waded to mid‑shin with a pole and felt gently for the shape the river wrote beneath the water. He did not jab; he listened with his hands.

“Here the bed shelves,” he said. “There is a bite where there was none last week.”

“Voice first,” Nathron said. He stood with his head tipped a fraction. “Hush, and hear it.”

Tolly heard the change when the wind came a little from the west. Not much; a rasp under the whisper, like linen drawn across a stone. He wrote, “west wind; ferrystone roughened,” and then, because it mattered, he wrote the numbers for the beats between a ripple and its echo on the bank. They were one shorter than the day before.

“Something touches what should not be touched,” Maralda said. “Not a hand, but the reach of a hand.” She pointed to a peel of clean sand up‑stream of the stone that had not been there yesterday. “A pole has poked there, and poked again.”

They did not go to it. Instead Nathron took the pole from Tomberic and went a little lower, to the beginning of the bad channel they had mapped by eye and ear. “If a skiff came here by night and thought itself clever, it would ride this tongue until the river made it confess.” He pressed, and the pole sank a hand‑breadth into a place that had no business being soft. He did not smile. “There,” he said. “That is a lie waking up.”

Tolly set his heel to a shallow groove on a post that had once been struck and laid his hand upon the grain. “If someone tries the bad way this morning, the post will tell us sooner than our eyes,” he said. “It speaks up the wood.”

They watched. The day brightened by degrees. The reed beds were quiet except for a moorhen giving its brief remark and forgetting the matter. Then, very small at first, a wake formed high in the far shallows: a cautious line set down as if by someone persuading himself that this was knowledge and not guessing. Tolly’s mouth went dry in the same foolish way as before; he did not mind it; he counted.

The wake came on until it reached the place where a man who knew the ford would have turned for the right run. It did not turn. It drew a neat curve toward the tongue of soft sand that Nathron had found. The pole under his hand gave the smallest shiver.

“Hold,” Nathron said, and put his other hand on the pole as if to keep it from talking too loud. “Let the river mind him.”

There was the muffled cry that rope makes when strain comes where it should not, and then the low scrape of wood on small stones that have no wish to be moved. Tolly felt it up the post, a little shudder that ran to his wrist. He did not speak. A memory flickered—old crackle in rafters, a night when strain had sounded before flame—but it passed like a moth against a window, leaving only the good habit of caution. In the wake there came a murky bloom where the sand lifted; then the line wobbled and held.

“Now he learns,” Tomberic said, “what a map is not.”

For a long half‑minute nothing changed. Then the line backed water in a cautious, shamefaced way and sought a safer place with little pushes. When it had gone three yards up‑stream of its mistake, it turned with ill grace to the proper run and went by on the far edge, keeping quiet as such things do when they hope no one has seen them.

“We will see what he leaves behind,” Nathron said. They waited until the water had cleared of its temper, then went down together to the post.

In the old groove was a fresher scrape, pale against the weathered wood. In the grain a new smear of tar lay dull, not glossy, as if rubbed rather than spilled. Below the waterline a single rope fibre had caught and held. Tolly lifted it on the point of his splinter and set it on a paper. He touched the tar and set the hour against it.

“Shall we move the bright stones now?” Tomberic asked. His tone was even, not heated; he had learned the ford’s manners.

“Not yet,” Nathron said. “We will tell the men who must hear, and we will come back with them. A stone moved in the right spirit is still a stone moved, and we will not give a clever fool an excuse to call us meddlers.”

“Then we will write the place more plainly,” Maralda said. She made a tracing in small of the post’s scar and put the rope fibre beside it and marked the line of the tongue that had tricked the skiff. “If we must show it to a Mayor, he will have what he needs to understand without walking in water. If we must show it to a Ranger, he will see without being told much.”

They tested once more, not to boast but to be sure. The pole found the soft again, a finger nearer to the ferrystone than before. The stone’s voice kept its roughness when the west wind breathed. Tolly wrote the numbers and the compass of the breeze and felt, for a moment, an odd steadiness, as if the world grew more itself when you listened honestly to it.

“You have learned the ford,” Nathron said to him, not as praise but as law. “Not all of it. Not forever. Enough for this morning.”

They left the post and went by the fork‑crown willow. Tolly set a split stick in the cleft and bound it with two plain turns; below that he put the small tight turn that meant “double the watches by dawn and dusk,” and below that again a loose loop to say “wait on the look.” He did not make a tidy row of clever signs. He made the few a man could read while the kettles sang.

At the Hay Gate the Bounders read the chalk‑board rota with its small dots at dawn and dusk and nodded as men nod when the day knows what it is about. Tolly showed them the tracing of the post scar and the bit of fibre through the paper. The elder Bounder put his hand on the board as if to feel the hardness of what was being asked of him.

“We will keep by bells,” he said. “We will not be tidy for strangers.”

“That is the good word,” Tomberic said. “A tidy thing can be counted from a hedge.”

They took the packet with the tracing and the notes up to Michel Delving by the road that saves a man’s boots, and by the time the sun thought of the west the clerk at the Mayor’s office had a neat copy of the morning’s work and Maralda’s plain sentence from the day before to set beside it. It was not a story that would put boys on barrels to shout; it was not meant to be. It was enough to keep doors shut at the right times and lanterns low.

When they returned to the ford in the long light, the river made cards of brightness over the shoals as if nothing in the world had ever been tested or found wanting. The ferrystone whispered to itself. Somewhere a dog barked twice in a distant yard, then found better things to do. They stood together a little, then went to their suppers by different paths with the sense that the day had put one more honest line on the map in their heads.
