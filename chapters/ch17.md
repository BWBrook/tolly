After harvest the light comes up like a man clearing his throat: modestly, and with a mind to get on. The lane by the Hay Gate held a coolness under its hedge where dew had set its quiet work, and the board at the post took the morning without warping. The boy with the chalk stood on tiptoe to test it, as if stubbornness could be measured by a finger’s push. Tomberic lifted the stringed chalk down and showed him how to take its measure at the top rail and at the bottom, and to trust the middle if both behaved.

Tolly came from the ford with a bit of willow rind clinging to his sleeve and the look of a man who has been listening to water. Maralda had two square copies under her arm, tied with red thread, and a third tucked in, because it is good practice to have one more than the number of hands promised. Nathron stood already with the elder Bounder, both reading the rota board with the sort of attention that makes any board hold itself straighter.

“After harvest,” the Bounder said to nobody in particular, as if the season itself were a helper whose back had earned a word. “A lane likes its rules best when the work is in, not in a drought or a crush.” He tapped the compact with one knuckle. “We will take these down to the ford overlook next and let their letters teach that board to stand up as tidy as this one.”

"We’ll bring spare string for the chalk," Tomberic said. "Chalk strings think themselves great travellers."
“We will carry the copies together by bells,” Maralda said to Tolly, as if it were the most natural sharing of weight in the world.

They went by the hedge path that keeps a man in friendly company with thorns to the small rise from which the ford can be counted stone by stone. The overlook was only a patch of sward with a view, a post set by a thoughtful Bounder some year or other, and a plank screwed into it that had done duty as a board and then thought better of it in rain. Maralda looked at the plank and at the knots that showed where rain had found a home; then she spread her clean copy and smoothed it as if smoothing a child’s hair.

“We will not make more show here than sense,” she said. “But we will write the same short words so that a man’s eyes do not have to change their gait between the posts.” She pinned the copy with two small tacks at the top and one at the bottom and tied the chalk as at the Gate.

The ferryman came up from the bank with his coat over one shoulder and a look that had more sleep than suspicion in it. He nodded to the Ranger and the Bounder and to the hobbits as to neighbours whose habits he had learned and approved of in the main.

“We’ve a knot to teach you,” Tolly said, holding the cord as one offers a useful tool and not a trick. “Tight turn for doubling dawn and dusk; straight tie for all watches as posted; loose loop for wait on the look. No secret to any of it, only a way to keep the mouth from outrunning the hands.”

The ferryman watched once, then twice, and made each of them without looking and with the sort of economy that belongs to men who live with ropes. “That will do,” he said. “I can tie talk as well as any man if it keeps a boat off a bar.” He looked at the board, at the brief lines, and at the chalk’s string. “And I will put that string right if it frays, for it irks me to see a thing fall apart for want of a penny’s care.”

They stood a moment together, six figures looking down at the ford where the ferrystone wore its familiar face. A breeze set the willow leaves trembling and laid a cheap gloss on the shallow patch where the wrong bar had been persuaded to pretend a channel. It failed at pretending now, like a story a boy is tired of telling but keeps for the pleasure of saying he has a story.

“No new cairns,” Nathron said. “No fresh tar on the low stakes.”

“No reeds answered,” the Bounder added, half to himself, writing it with his own voice so the day would keep the note.

From the south a rider showed, slow and courteous. He came without hurry, as men come who have learned that being thought dull is another way to keep a thing safe. He had the habit of Rangers about him, but he was not Nathron or any other of the small company that had kept watch at hand. He saluted, then took a folded strip from his coat and held it with two fingers so that both the giving and the keeping were modest.

“A message relayed,” he said, “from the watches farther south. Keep the watches.” He did not say more, and he did not look as if he would, but there was a hint of a smile about his mouth that had more weather than jest in it. “Said to come by a grey pilgrim, courteous and in haste, who prefers that good rules do the walking without him.”

“Then we will not make him walk here,” the Bounder said, grave and pleased. He took the strip and pinned it for a day below the compact so that the words would have a chance to sink in, even though no one present was likely to forget words so simple.

Tolly wrote the line on the ledger square in the same hand as the rest, for a ledger is a place where short things belong. “Message relayed from south: Keep the watches.” He did not add any name to that, for the name mattered less than the keeping.

They went down again by the bank to where the ferry plank should be checked after a freshet, and Maralda ran her hand along the wood as if it were a creature that could sulk if ignored. “No cracks that matter,” she said. “A scrub of sand and a dab of tar when the day is good and hot.” The ferryman agreed; he would do it without any posting to tell him so.

On the way back to the Gate they met two young Bounders coming the other way, each with a staff that looked older than its owner. The boy with the chalk introduced the second as if he were introducing a dog he was proud of because it learned to sit. He taught the tight turn with a satisfaction so tidy it almost tidied the knot by itself.

“If you tie it with your eyes looking elsewhere,” Tolly said, “you will have it when a man thinks to count your fingers and finds only your courtesy.”

The new boy laughed with that lightness a person has when he learns something neat without being made to feel the lesson was a penance. He tied the knot again without looking, then unmade it so it would not be wasted and clapped the chalk boy on the shoulder as if he had been shown where the good blackberries were.

Toward noon a single traveller came off the Greenway spur with a pack that had been tied and untied more times than it had been carried and with an anxious way of looking at his own bootlaces. He asked after the ford and whether a man might cross at his own wit if his wit were willing to learn. They gave him water and the sort of talk that does not fence a man in but shows him where the hedges stand. He ate a bite and decided he would, in fact, like to see how a ferry looks in daylight. The Bounder noted the time on the board: a dot and a short word, “escort,” nothing about the man that would follow him past the ford into any tales he did not wish for.

“We are doing little things,” Tomberic said, leaning against the post as if leaning were a craft. “Little things are the kind that do not need to be done all over again if you do them in time.”

"And they keep a certain sort of man from thinking he is a hero when he is only tidy," Maralda returned, which was as near as she came to teasing. She tied a red sliver to the edge of her second copy and passed it to the Bounder. “Mayor’s copy and Mathom-house copy will carry tonight. Tomberic can bear the service copies. If anyone wishes to see how a rule looks when tied, he can ask the ferryman. He has learned to tie talk.” Tolly steadied the strap of her satchel while she worked, and neither spoke of it.

They took the fork‑crown willow on the way back and stood a moment with the habit of men who like to check a thing when they have told themselves they were finished checking for the day. The split stick token sat quiet. Tolly touched it, untying the tight turn it did not need now, leaving only the straight tie for “all watches as posted.” Below it the loose loop for “wait on the look” was left alone, because waiting is a thing a gate does whether men write it down or not.

“That is what an ordinary day looks like when it behaves,” Nathron said, not to claim it but to remember it. “If it changes, your boards will tell you. If it does not, your boards will become pieces of the lane, which is the highest honour a board can hope for.”

They sat in the shade a short time, because men who keep lanes must let lanes keep them from time to time, and Tolly wrote out two new clean copies of the compact on square paper, each tied with red thread and labelled in the corner in a neat hand: “Hay Gate post—file; ford overlook—file.” He made sure the thread’s ends were short so they would not catch on the board and give a passer‑by a reason to fuss with them. Maralda took a last look and slid one copy into Tolly’s satchel without comment, keeping the other for her own. It is a small thing, to divide paper, and a large one when it forecasts work shared.

In the afternoon a crow‑flight came east and counted the lines of hedge without drawing much attention; it was ordinary counting, more like a man who checks his pockets before leaving a house than like an auditor. The birds dropped out of sight one by one and then rose again when it suited them. The ferrystone kept its old voice, a hair lower by evening and then steady.

At day’s end they walked together as far as the chalk road where talk is expected to be brief and neighbourly. Nathron took the path south with the other Ranger who had brought the brief message; the Bounders turned back along the hedge; the ferryman went down to see to his oars. Tomberic touched the posted board, which is an odd habit to pick up but not a disrespectful one, and grinned as if the wood had answered him.

“We keep the watches,” he said.

“We do,” the Bounder said. “And we keep them in a way that makes no song and shortens no man by being kept.”

Tolly looked once more down the lane toward the ford, and the picture that came to him had no drama in it: only a plank, a stone, a willow, a line of water with its own loyal talk, and a board with plain words. He thought of the day when such boards might be taken for granted or taken down, and he did not hurry to pick one of those thoughts. He set his hand to the post and felt the grain. Memory is a kind of watch, he thought, and he had work enough to do at both.
