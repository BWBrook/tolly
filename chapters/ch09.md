The bell at the Hay Gate spoke the hour with the dry, homely note that sits well on a hedged lane. The Bounder post smelled of onion skins and old rope, and a kettle steamed on the low fire as if work were another sort of weather to be made bearable by warmth. Tolly came up the rise with Tomberic, and Maralda a step behind with her square papers put away, for it was a morning for talk, not measuring.

The elder Bounder, broad, hay in his hair, patience in his jaw, raised a hand. “There’s been no trouble since last night,” he said, “unless you count a boy who thinks three notes on a reed a clever way to fetch a loaf from his mam without crossing the lane. We gave him a chore and he forgot his music.” His eyes shifted to Tolly’s pocket with a small question. “And your folk?”

“We heard a lay from the far bank at first light,” Tolly said, “and saw wolf‑sign on wet sand. Our watch doubles at dawn and dusk until the river has another tale. We brought no names and no horns.”

“You brought your wits, then,” said another Bounder, younger and eager, with the quickness of a man who has not yet had enough quiet mornings to learn that quiet is a comfort. Even as he spoke he turned his head toward the hedge, where a thin note sounded as if the wind had found a hollow reed. It came three times in a row, neat as too‑tidy numbers.

The young Bounder took one pace toward the ferry path. Tomberic did not put a hand on him; he only said, the way an uncle might, “By bells, lad.”

The Bounder stopped. The elder’s face did not change, but his hands moved without fuss to take the younger’s staff and set it back against the post where it belonged.

“That will be our first countersign,” the elder said, as if he were deciding that a field would do better with beans than with barley. “Not a password to be shouted, but a reminder: by bells. We do not answer strangers by river, not now.”

“And the second,” Maralda said, “may be a lantern lesson set in words, so it can travel by paper to the next watch: ‘lantern low, never still’. It says two things plainly and tells nothing to a nose at the hedge.”

“Write them,” the elder said. “And write them as proverbs, so a man feels foolish forgetting what his grandsire would have known.”

They went into the lee of the hedge where the wind was less, and there, with the bell quieting, they made a list that would pass the Bounder post without need of explanation and would not hang tidy signs where tidy eyes could count them. They kept it short:

• By bells: no answers to unknown reeds; meet by day.
• Lantern low, never still.
• One tale per day: split stick or notch, not both.
• Name little; mark much.

“A man can carry four in his head and not lose his way between kettle and gate,” the elder said. “If we make twelve, they will be dropped like peas on a floor.”

“Four will do,” Tolly said, “if we add a way of saying ‘friend’ when friend comes late. Something not too neat.”

They did not choose a call‑and‑answer; they chose a manner of speaking. If a man came after dark and said, “The hedge kept me,” the Bounder on duty would answer, “The lane will mend it,” and no more need be said. It was a Shire way of being careful, and to any ear that did not understand it would be a neighbour’s talk about thorns and mud. Nathron, who had come up quiet at the bell and now stood with his hands folded as if he had always been there, nodded once and let the word settle.

“If you will write that on your square, Maralda,” he said, “we will carry it along the ford in our heads. We do not love passwords. We love remembering how neighbours speak.”

“The rota,” the younger Bounder put in, eager to be useful and to make up for his one pace toward the reed. “We can keep dawn and dusk with two and a lantern between, if the miller’s boy can be spared and Tom Cotton from up the lane will stand the afternoon.”

“Set it,” the elder said. He looked to Tolly. “Write us the hours plain, and do not put more names on paper than you must. We will hang it where the old notices go and we will take it down when the moon changes.”

They worked a little while with a stick of chalk on a smooth board hung by the gate. Maralda wrote neat as ever, because neatness is its own sort of courtesy. Tolly watched the steadiness of her hand and felt the board become more trustworthy under the chalk. The rota was ordinary: names, bells, and whether a man would keep a lantern or a staff. The only new mark was a small dot beside dawn and dusk that meant “count before you answer”. No outsider would know to look for it; no neighbour would miss it once told.

When they had done, Nathron gave them a quiet piece to carry. “There are men who like signals to be clever,” he said. “We do not want clever. We want what a hobbit can keep in his coat when he is tired and still be a good neighbour.” He looked at the younger Bounder not unkindly. “If a reed calls three times at night, it is asking for a fool. Do not be the fool.”

“I will not,” the young man said. “By bells.” He said it as if he were tasting a word that would suit him for years.

A lad from the mill came with a paper under his arm and an ink‑horn in his hand, sent by the mayor’s office to ask what new notices were to be seen to. Maralda gave him a copy of the four lines in her small, clerkly hand with the heading “for courtesy and watch”. The heading mattered; men obey better when a thing is named in a manner that does not prick their pride.

“There is one more matter,” the elder Bounder said, and his eyes went to the hedge again. “Some folk do not mean harm, but they like to carry tales as if they were real work. If we speak too much of wolves in the same breath as the ford, we will have half the lanes drunk on fright by nightfall.”

“Then speak little of wolves,” Nathron said, “and much of watch. Wolves go where the land pleases them, and we do not tell them our business by crying about it. We tell our friends only what they can carry without stumbling.”

They took their tea from the kettle and sat on the low bench while the road went on with its usual business. Two carts passed with their axles singing; a waggon from Nobottle rolled by and the driver lifted a hand as if to scrape the sky of any clouds that might trouble him later. The bells in the far lanes answered one another as they so often do, like cousins talking across a field.

A Bounder from the north stile arrived with a tale that would have been naughty if it had not been so small: a pair of lads with a reed and a dare. He was given an onion to take home to his wife and no more. Rules work best when they do not make too big a meal of boyhood.

Near noon, a fellow who smelled of damp leather and road dust came to the gate and asked, very politely, whether a ferry ran for folk with business to the south when the sun lay high. He had a careful way of not saying anything wrong that said enough. The elder Bounder gave him the manner one gives to a stranger who might have a cousin in the Shire and might not.

“Our ferries run by day for folk we know,” he said. “If you have business that can be done by daylight, you can do it by the Brandywine Bridge and you will find your friends waiting for you there as well as anywhere. By bells.”

The man thanked him in a tone that asked for nothing more and went away. He had not crossed; he had not learned any tidy thing that would carry; he had been shown enough courtesy to make impertinence harder another time.

“That is the way,” Nathron said, when the dust of the man’s boots had settled. “Make ordinary doors heavier and leave no open windows for spies to creep through.”

They pinned the paper with the four lines to the post and made a second copy for the miller’s board and a third for Michel Delving. Maralda wrote a fourth to keep in the Mathom‑house box, with the day’s bell marked on it and a note in the margin: “Hay Gate: countersigns agreed with Rangers; dawn/dusk double watch; reed whistles not answered; lanterns low.” She bound it with red thread: to be saved.

Before they left, Tolly and the elder Bounder walked the short distance to the fork‑crown willow and looked at the split‑stick token. Tolly adjusted the twine by a hair, to say “message read,” and put in the knot he had learned for “watch doubled” that morning, tight enough to mean business and loose enough to be pulled with one hand if the tale changed by evening.

“When this is all done,” the elder said, almost to himself, “and the year turns to other matters, these small ways will still be good ways. I do not know what is coming, but I know we will be better neighbours for having kept our manners.”

“That is what we are keeping,” Tolly said. “The ford is a river matter. Courtesy is ours.”

They returned to the post. Tomberic had written the rota in chalk with a steadier hand than usual and a little pride in the neatness, though he would not admit it. The younger Bounder had started peeling the onions before being asked. Nathron stood at the edge of the hedge with his head turned to the south and the sort of stillness that makes birds forget a man is there.

“Keep the watches,” he said, when they had made their last read of the paper to be sure no word would be misunderstood by a man in a hurry. “Keep the proverbs too.”

They went away by the lane that runs beside the quickset and turns toward the Green Hill Country. It was an unremarkable walk in the best sense; they said little, and what they said was all courtesies to one another, to the road, to the work yet to be done. By bells at the next farm a child’s voice was reading the rota aloud to an older cousin with great seriousness, and that was the best sign of the day: that the words had gone into a small head without frightening it.
