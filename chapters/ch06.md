By sundown the willows along the ford had the colour of old brass, and their leaf‑backs showed pale where the light lay low. Tolly and Tomberic walked the edge of the willow‑holt in that quiet which comes when a day has done most of its work and is pleased with itself. Maralda kept a little way behind with the square papers ready, for the river had voices she meant to set in order once they had listened to them long enough.

They had left the watch‑house after the bell, when the stew‑pot had been put aside and the small talk put away like a spoon. The token at the fork‑crown willow stood as they had left it; no notch at the hollow rail spoke any new word. The river’s thin talk ran on. The ferrystone’s whisper kept fair.

“We will look to the bars above the bend,” Tolly said, “where the gravel seems to change its mind twice between one willow and the next.” It was not a command; it was only the sort of sentence that minds make when they have begun to take a place inside themselves as if it were another room at home.

They went by a shallowing where a brown bird skittered; they crossed a small runnel and came to a tongue of gravel that ran out as if to taste the current. Here the pebbles were mixed, river‑worn, river‑coloured, save for three neat stones that sat brighter than their neighbours and in a line that could be seen from a little way off if one were the sort to look for such things.

“White by half,” Tomberic said softly.

“And set to be seen,” Tolly answered. He crouched and did not touch them. “A cairn should grow by the hand that remembers a place, not by a stranger’s guess. These are too clean for this bar, too tidy for this mood of water.”

Maralda knelt and set her paper against a flat stone and drew the line as it lay, with the willows behind and the shallow beyond. She did not make a map that a stranger could use; she made a memory that a neighbour could keep. She marked the brighter stones with a small star and the river’s slower colour with a wash of pencil.

“It is a little thing,” she said, “but little things add.”

They followed the bar to where it swung back toward the bank, and there, just at the place where a skiff’s pole might reach for help when the bottom fell away a hand’s breadth too soon, a stake showed with a smear of tar upon its grain. The tar was not old; it had the sharpness of a pot warmed again after being left to cool. On a snag nearby, a twist of something dark clung and shivered in the faint air.

Tolly drew out his splinter and lifted the scrap. It was no more than the ragged edge of a cloth that had once turned water (tarred or waxed), torn where thoughtless hands had pulled too quick. He laid it on Maralda’s paper and let it sit a moment in the last light before she folded it away in a small packet and tied it with a single turn of red thread.

“The cairns point over this,” Tomberic said, toeing the bright stones without moving them. “A fool might steer by them and ground his bow; a clever man might set them there to learn what fools will do. Either way they are not ours.”

“Nor the river’s,” Tolly said. He looked along the bar and down the reach to the ferrystone. “And yet we will not set our will against them with our hands. There’s courtesy in letting a wrong show itself before we name it wrong to the men who must hear.”

“So we will let our pencils move where our hands will not,” Maralda said. She drew the three bright marks again, and the raised point where a fourth might be set if a hasty man wanted his line to carry further. “And when we come back by morning, we will see whether any hand has been busier than ours in the night.”

They went further along the edge of the willow‑holt to another small bar that sat like a sleeper’s lip under the willows’ shade. Here, too, were stones that did not belong: a tiny pyramid no higher than a hobbit’s thumb, set where a pole‑tip would like to try its luck. Tolly put his hand to the water and felt the shape of the current with his skin (an old game in streams at home, turned to use now—and then took his hand away and shook the drops off with care so none should fall upon the wrong place and make a muddle in a small world.

“This one is new‑set,” he said. “The sand beneath shows the print of the finger that pressed it. The river has not yet had its say.”

Tomberic bent close, then drew back without touching. “I would not rebuild a lie,” he said, “and I will not topple a stranger’s tale when I can write a truer one beside it.” He turned to Maralda. “Set it down as it lies.”

“Set down, and with the hour,” Maralda said. “And we will add the river’s voice, which cares nothing for lies when it has a mind to speak.”

They made their way back toward the bend where the willow‑roots grip, taking the shore between the bars so as not to leave steps upon the shapes they meant to remember. Tolly took his bearings by three ordinary things: a knotted root, a weed with a torn leaf, and a brown pebble with a streak of pale running through it like a string of cream. He drew them quickly in the corner of a page and wrote the numbers a Ranger had taught him: paces to the ferrystone, paces to the fork‑crown willow, paces to the blind. He did not know if his numbers would match another man’s, but they would match his own tomorrow, and that was the beginning of knowing.

When the light leaned lower they sat for a little in the blind, listening. A crow came to a willow and stood a moment with its head sideways, then went along the reach without making a penny of noise. A reed clicked twice to itself. None of it asked for an answer.

“If we had a mind to set a warning where a warning would do most good,” Tomberic said after a while, “we might lay three plain stones of the river’s own colour over near the safe run and let a fool puzzle the difference. But perhaps that is two tales in a day.”

“One tale per day,” Tolly said, remembering, and the remembering pleased him. He did not know when a Ranger’s rule had begun to feel like something a hobbit could keep in his pocket along with a string and a bit of chalk, but that was how it sat with him now.

They rose when the first chill came up from the gravel and walked once more past the bright stones without altering them. At the stake where the tar had stained the grain, Tolly touched the smear with the back of a fingernail and sniffed it. The scent was still sharp under the willow smell.

“Write it: tar new at low stake,” he said. “And here,”—he pointed with the splinter—“weed caught below the mark, turned back toward the bar as if dragged. That argues a pull the other way.”

Maralda wrote, and under the line she put a small thought: “Three bright stones do not make a ford unless the river agrees.” It was the sort of sentence that keeps itself when a man finds it again in a paper years later and wonders how he knew it then.

On their way back they went by the fork‑crown willow and looked to the split stick they had left; a small change showed in the twist of the twine that only eyes that had tied it would have seen. Nathron’s men had read it and put it back with a half‑turn that said “we have your word.” Tolly smiled and untied the half‑turn and made the stick as it had been.

“Tomorrow,” he said, “we will stand in a new place and see if the stones have stood to their insolence. If they have not, the man who set them may be setting another mischief. If they have, we will have another line on our paper, and a better reason to bring our neighbours to stand and listen.”

“And we will bring no more than a pencil and a proverb,” Maralda said, folding her papers away.

“And a pocket for rope ends,” Tomberic added, “in case a fibre chooses to turn up where it ought not.”

They walked back in a good quiet with the willows at their shoulders and the shallows talking small. The day had not given them a skiff to scold nor a man to catch by the sleeve, and that was as well. It had given them a little packet with a scrap of tarred cloth in it, a drawing of bright stones set where they did no honest work, and a few more small numbers in a book.

“It adds,” Tolly said, and if he had been the sort to count more finely, he would have said that the adding made a shape that looked more and more like a hand.
