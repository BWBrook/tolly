At first light the ford wore a pale veil, and the reed beds stood with their heads tipped as if they had slept badly and were thinking better of it. The ferrystone showed truer than last evening, a thumb higher over the lace of water, and its voice was thin as a thread pulled tight. Tolly stood with his notebook shut, because there is a kind of listening that takes two hands, and counted the heartbeats between the little hiss on the shallows and the soft push on the bank below his knee.

“Two and a breath,” he said at last.

“As yesterday,” Maralda answered. She had the square papers ready but did not yet open them. “Let us not write until the ford thinks we deserve a line.”

Tomberic went a little way along the reed bed and crouched. The light caught on a length of cord that someone had wound about a bundle of reeds, not in the manner of a tidy thatcher but as if the reeds themselves were the paper for a message. The cord was plain brown; the knots were not what a Shire boy would tie to fasten a lunch bundle nor what a ferryman would make with cold hands when logic fails and habit saves him. They were purposeful.

“Look here,” Tomberic said, quiet, and Tolly came to his elbow. “There is a single overhand, then two together tight, then a little space, then a loop that has not been drawn hard. That is not to keep reeds from splaying.”

“No,” Tolly said. “That is to say ‘one, two, wait’ to someone who knows where to look. The loop is a mouth kept ready to speak.” He looked along the margin where scattered reeds had drifted against the bed. Three more bundles lay in a loose row; each had a cord with a small pattern. He did not touch them. “Take the shapes with your eyes and set them on your paper,” he said to Maralda, who had come up behind them and was already drawing the first cord in careful small lines.

“If a man wished to mark an hour,” she said, “he might tie a pair to stand for the bells, then leave a space for the time between, and let a loop speak: ‘when the water looks so and so, bring the skiff’.”

“Or, if he wished to tell his friend which of the bars to try,” Tomberic said, “he might set a bundle at each with a different mouth on the cord, and the friend would count ‘one, two’ and choose by the loop.”

“We will not guess too far,” Tolly said, though he could feel the shape of the idea in his fingers like a string that wants pulling. “We will write what is under the eyes and keep the rest for later.” He sounded more like Maralda than he knew, and that pleased her.

They worked along the reed bed while the sun made gold of the tips and picked out the faint lines where water has gone and come again. Maralda drew the knots as they lay, each on a little square with a mark for the distance between one bundle and the next. She wrote the river’s condition beside the drawings: “light out of west; ferrystone whisper high; foam‑speed even.” Tolly said the words aloud once, to hear them. He did not know if he would always have Maralda’s numbers beside him; he wanted to carry them better in his head, the way a man carries a good proverb without needing to look for it.

At the third bundle a change showed: the cord had a twist of colour. Not the black‑and‑green of the buyer’s string, but a thread of green only, faint, as if someone had tried to make a cousin to the true thing and had not had the knack.

“That is meant to be seen by a careful man,” Tolly said. “And to be missed by a tired one.”

“Set it down as an error or an experiment,” Maralda said, drawing the faint stripe as a pale line. “There are men who like neatness more than sense. They will love knots for the sake of knots and forget that rivers are not obliged.”

“The river will answer them in its own time,” Tomberic said. He stood and looked over the bed to the ferrystone. “Does it seem to you that the stone’s face carries a stain lower down on the upstream side than it did?”

Tolly narrowed his eyes. He had made a little sketch of the stone the day before with two notches on the bank as sights to make sure of where his eye would be when he drew it again. He took the paper out and held it at arm’s length and looked from paper to stone and back. The stain lay a finger lower in the drawing than on the stone itself. He did not feel proud; pride is poor company when a mistake wants owning.

“My drawing was hasty,” he said. “Or the light was other. The voice is the same, and that is better proof than the stain.” He set this down as plain as it was, and Maralda did not praise him for the honesty because honesty should be as common as bread.

They came then to a place where the reed bed gave way to a little beach of clean sand. Here someone had stood and sorted cords by length and mood; there were cut ends tramped into the damp and a mark of a heel that had no Shire feel. The nails were set wider in the leather than a Westfarthing man carries; the point under the big toe was pressed deep as if the foot had braced against a pull.

“The same sort as by Longbottom’s old gate‑prop,” Maralda said quietly. She did not make a story of it; she set it beside the other things they knew, as you lay a tool back in a drawer.

“If you were to tell a man to come by night and test the shallows,” Tomberic said, looking downriver, “and you had not seen the ford yourself, you might bid him make a little line of bright stones and knot the reeds with these silly mouths and trust that the river would do the rest.”

“And then the river would teach you that it is older than your string,” Tolly said. He crouched to examine a loop that had been pulled into a long oval, then let go. It had been made by fingers that did not know this water, and the water had answered by turning the knot just so and no more. “Here is a word I can read: ‘someone guessed and the river forgot the answer by morning’.”

They took breakfast late by the blind: bread gone dry at the edges, a bit of cheese, and water in a bottle that had rested in the ford till it was cool. While they ate, a crow came and sat on a stump of willow near the blind and looked at them sideways. When Tomberic crumbled his crust, the bird sidled nearer, and from the reeds a small thin man, the sort you might call a tramp if you were unkind and a traveller if you wanted to keep your doors open, rose and made as if to pick the crumbs from under the bird with two fingers.

“Mind your luck,” Tomberic said mildly, “the crow found its dinner first.”

The man grinned without teeth and made a little bow with his shoulders. “I mind the river,” he said. “It minds me. The crows do as they please, and the river does as it pleases, and I do as I must.” He took no more than a few crumbs, and he did not come nearer than a man with courtesy will; then he drifted off along the shallows, where a fellow could pick up a stick for fuel and not leave a mark anyone would bother about.

“He fed the crow without feeding us a story,” Maralda said softly. “All the same, set a dot for the sighting. Those that live near rivers learn things they do not say because the river does not like to be talked over.”

They returned to the knots. Tolly began to see a primer in them: single knot to call attention; double knot for the bells; loop loose to mean ‘wait on the look of the water’; loop tight to mean ‘set off now’; a little tuck of tail under itself to say ‘choose the left bar’. He spoke no more than needed; Maralda set the primer on paper and added “uncertain” where a guess would be a guess and no more.

“We will only carry what we would be willing to defend in front of the Mathom‑house board,” she said at last, binding the squares with red thread and putting them away from damp. “The rest is talk for the road.”

“And for the Ranger,” Tolly said. “He will know which of these mouths are the ones a man would speak and which are nonsense.”

By mid‑morning the wind turned a little into the ford and made the ferrystone whisper lower. Tolly heard it and found, to his small inward gladness, that his ear placed the change as surely as the pencil wrote it. The knots meant less to him then than the stone did; the stone had an older grammar.

They walked the line of the reed bed once more to see if any hand had moved what they had left. A bundle had gone from the place with the faint green thread; the sand there was scuffed as by a heel and a pole‑tip. Another bundle had been retied; the double knot had become three small pulls that told no tale. Tolly wrote this, and beneath it he put a plain hope: “those who count from afar have been made to count again.”

When the sun came up to the place where men begin to think of dinner even if there is none in their satchel, they made their last round to the ferrystone. Tolly set his sights again on the notches he had marked and drew the stone afresh. The stain on the upstream face lay where it had, and the voice was the same. He wrote, “stone faithful; sight amended.” It pleased him to put the error under the right word where he could see it next time and not tell it again by accident.

“We have enough for a day,” Maralda said at last. “If we add more, we will only be moving sand with a spoon to see whether the water dislikes our spoon.”

“And I dislike a sandy spoon,” Tomberic said cheerfully. He looked downriver and shaded his eyes. “No skiff this morning. Perhaps last night’s lesson stuck.”

“Lessons often do,” Tolly said, “when they are given by stones.”

They left the ford by the path that keeps a man’s boots from the worst of the damp and paused by the fork‑crown willow to set a split stick with two turns of plain twine. On the top turn Tolly made a little twist that meant “primer found; not yet believed”. He did not know whether that was a Ranger’s word, but it was a hobbit’s, and it would be read by men who knew how to read such things.

Back at the watch‑house, he spread the squares on the table and wrote a single line on the sheet that held the day’s notes: “Reed‑knots likely code; examples copied; ferrystone voice constant; bundles moved by unseen hand.” Maralda set her packet in the box that held the red‑threaded things. Tomberic hung the kettle and put two extra sticks to the fire because counting takes more out of a man than walking.

Outside, the river ran on in its old manner, which is the best way for a river to run when folk must sleep near it without worry. The crows made a mild muster and then turned their backs to the wind. Nothing extraordinary happened, which is a sort of grace. The day had begun with knots and ended with stew, and between the two there was enough honest work to keep a mind from inventing adventures that were not needed.
