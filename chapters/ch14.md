By bells the lane to the Hay Gate was already busy with the kind of business that looks like idleness to men who have not kept a hedge: a boy with chalk in his pocket and orders to count posts; an old Bounder rubbing a staff with oil and telling it the news; a cart that had decided to wait outside the gate until its creak would not sound like an interruption. The hedge there, quickset and stubborn, kept its face as if nothing in the world could ask it to move. The post stood like a good neighbour who has learned when to talk and when to listen.

Tolly came up with Tomberic and Maralda as the first bell finished its plain speech. Nathron had beat them to the place and stood a little aside, not in the doorway but not in the brush either, as a man does when he wants to be part of a thing without making it his. The elder Bounder, square as a gate‑post and patient as a stone, nodded to each in turn and then looked at the chalk he held as if it were a kind of oath.

“By bells,” he said, so that the time lived in the work. “We will make our rules as plain as bread and post them where a passer‑by can take a slice without any spice spoiling it.”

Maralda unrolled the copy she had written in square hand. She had tied it with a sliver of red thread so that whoever took it up after today would know it was part of a chain and not a scrap torn off a sack. “These are the words we have lived by in fact,” she said, “and now we live by them in ink.”

She read while the chalk waited:

1) No answering of unknown reeds. If a call cannot be named, it is not for us.
2) Lantern low, never still. Keep light near the ground; do not hang a steady flame where it can be counted.
3) Day escort for strangers who ask the ford; none sent by night.
4) Double watches at dawn and dusk while the river sits lower.
5) One token tale per day: brief, factual notes for the next watch.
6) Name little, mark much. Keep courtesy with strangers; keep details for the ledger.
7) No moving of stones or cairns without joint action agreed at the post.

“Put them up,” the Bounder said, and the boy set to his chalk with a pride that did not look like pride until a man knew boys. He chalked the rota board with the dawn and dusk dots and wrote “By bells” across the top in letters like fence rails. Tolly added a neat hand to the lower right for the token line: “tight turn = double watches; loose loop = wait on the look.” He tied a sample string to the corner so that a Bounder could learn with fingers as well as eyes.

Tomberic went with a second Bounder to the ferry path and checked the ferrystone’s voice where it took the river on the cheek. It gave the same low talk it had given two days past, no more, no less. They looked to the jetty as well, and there the missing net that had set tongues jangling was found safe enough, folded and hung to dry under the small lean‑to. The ferryman’s boy, who had meant no trouble and had not liked being thought the cause of any, went pink and promised to tie a red rag on anything hung out of place next time. Tomberic clapped his shoulder and said that honest work is its own apology when a man hears it.

At the post the elder Bounder took up the chalk again and wrote a small line beyond the rules: “Mayor and Mathom-house copies made; Ranger copy kept.” Maralda handed over two fair copies, each marked with red thread. She kept the third for Nathron’s folk. “Plain words and short,” she said. “So short that a man who means to twist them will find himself with nothing to hold.”

“We keep our side,” Nathron said. “Our watches double at dawn and dusk until the river tells another tale. If a light is shown across water, we will make no answer. If a man comes by night asking your ford, we will say day is the only safe road.”

“And we will say it with a cup in hand,” the Bounder added, “for a man can swallow a rule easier with stew than with a shout.”

They walked the length of the hedge and fixed where the chalk would hang, where the board would keep dry, where a tired man could read without stooping. Tolly set the split stick at the fork‑crown willow in the hollow lane as they had agreed—tight turn above, loose loop below—so that the message lived both in words and in wood. Maralda pinned a small square near the rota with the ferry rules: ferrystone check by first bell and by last; bars cleared only after freshet and only by joint hands; any twine or cord found to be brought to the post and marked, not pocketed as useful string.

While they worked, a reed call came from beyond the hedge, not loud and not very artful: three quick and a slow, as if someone had learned a tune without knowing what song it belonged to. The boy looked up, hungry for the doing of a thing. The elder Bounder put a hand out, not to stop him from courage but to teach him what kind of courage this was.

“By bells,” the Bounder said, and that was the countersign agreed. The boy swallowed his answer and kept his chalk. The call came again, and nothing in the Shire moved to own it. After a little, the call went away and left only the sound of a waggon far off and a dog who believed in news that was not there.

“You see,” Nathron said, with a softness that did not talk down to the boy. “Some work is done by standing still at the right hour.”

The boy nodded and returned to his letters, and they were better for the pause.

By second bell the board stood tidy, the rota dots were set, and the copies were folded for their errands. Tomberic shouldered the service copy for Longbottom. Maralda wrapped the Mayor’s and Mathom-house copies together with their red tie; the Bounder tucked the post copy into its slot behind the board. A matching copy hung at the ford overlook.

They did a last small round to see that nothing said more than it should. The rules were plain; the tokens quiet; the hedge unremarkable to anyone who loved only loud things. The lane had the look of a place that had always known good sense, and only today had decided to write it down. Maralda looked at the small dots beside dawn and dusk and at the neat line Tolly had put on the slate and said, low enough for him alone, “This will hold when we are elsewhere.”

“Keep the watches,” Nathron said, as he had said before. He meant it as a farewell and a promise both.

“We will,” the elder Bounder answered. “And when the bells speak, we will listen, and when a reed speaks that is not ours, we will let it talk to itself.” He looked at Tolly with a wry turn of the mouth. “You write down the day in your tidy way. I will teach the boy to spell ‘lantern’ without making six letters do the work of seven.”

Tolly laughed, which is good for rules when they are new. He wrote his short lines on the slate where they would dry unbothered: “By bells: rules posted at Hay Gate. Rota chalked; dawn/dusk dots set. Ferry rules pinned: ferrystone by first and last; bars by joint hands; cord found to post. Missing net found and marked. Unknown reed calls ignored. Tokens set at fork‑crown willow. Copies made for Mayor, Mathom-house, Rangers. No names.”

The day stood up to full height and the lane took on its ordinary talk again—cart‑creak, gate‑click, the light scuff of a dog deciding whether to be important. The board with its neat letters looked like any other bit of Shire sense: something you might pass a hundred times and only half see until the day you needed it. That is the right way for such things. They should be there, and be read, and then be forgotten in the way that makes them part of the lane.
