By sundown Longbottom’s sheds had the quiet of a day that has put away its tools. The steward received them with the same even manner as before and set the ledger on the table under the window. There was dust in the long light; it showed the air’s small business and then forgot it. Maralda laid three packets on the table and untied them: the pages of copied tallies, the square sheets of reed knots with their distances and river conditions, and the bar drawings with the brighter stones marked in a neat hand. Tolly added the tarred scrap in its paper and the small rope fibre set under a slate.

"We have brought you what we were able to see without meddling," Maralda said. “We have left what we could have touched where the river left it. Now we must speak the shape of it plain, so that the Mayor and the Mathom-house may keep a memory that is not muddled.”

The steward put his hand to the ledger. “Begin with the book,” he said. “A man sleeps sounder when the numbers come first.”

Maralda turned the pages to the three entries marked in the margin. “These,” she said, tapping the copied signs in her own packet, “and the thread on the string that Tolly found. We will not name the men who carried the bales. The lots were lawful, and the roads between neighbours will not be improved by gossip. Yet the marks repeat enough to be more than fashion.”

“Aye,” said the steward. “Three is a crowd in a ledger. I will not deny it.”

Tolly opened the knot pages. “These cords,” he said, and he held one sheet at arm’s length so the steward could see the simple lines drawn as knots, “lay on the reed beds along the ford. Some were retied by morning. Some had a loop kept loose as if to say ‘wait’. Some had two pulls together as if to mean ‘by bells’. We do not claim to know all the mouths such knots can make. We say only that they were set to be read.”

He laid, beside the knots, the drawing of the bar where the brighter stones sat in a little line. “These stones would carry a fool into shallows. They would carry a clever man to believe he had learned the ford when he had learned a shoal. Either way, they are not this river’s manner.”

Maralda took up her pencil. “If we must write the shape of it for a board,” she said, and her voice had the clerk’s steadiness that good paper deserves, “we might set it so.” She wrote as she spoke, and the steward watched the words land. Tolly did too, and liked how her sentences made room for a neighbour to stand inside them.

“One: There have been knots tied on reeds under the ford’s willows which do not serve any simple thatcher’s or ferryman’s purpose. They repeat across mornings. Two: There is a line of stones brighter than the bar that holds them, placed so that a skiff might test a wrong path. Three: There are tallies on certain leaf bales carrying a waxed palm mark and a twist of black and green that is not this barn’s habit. Four: Fresh tar and a rope fibre have been found at places that fit the pattern of a skiff grounding and backing off.”

She paused and looked at them. “Five,” she said more softly, and then she set the words down because words must be put down when they are ready, “taken together, these are consistent with someone testing the ford and its approaches by means that can be read at a distance. We do not say who. We do not say from where. We say only that a mind is at work where the river has a right to be left to its own lessons.”

The steward breathed out and put both hands flat on the table as if to feel the wood remember what had been laid on it. “You have not written more than you can carry,” he said at last. “That sits well with me.” He looked at the fibre and the tarred scrap, then at the knots again. “A man can be shown a wrong way by tidy things. Our folk are good folk. They like tidy. We will teach them to like courtesy more.”

Tolly turned, at that, to the window. The light in the yard had gone more yellow. A boy dragged a broom along a threshold in lines that would have pleased any Mayor and any aunt, and Tolly liked him for it and trusted him more when he imagined the boy reading the four lines posted at the Hay Gate and remembering them as if they had been told at his own table. It is easier to keep faith, he thought, when the keeping sits in short words and a steady hand.

"We will carry a copy to the Mayor’s office," Maralda said, “and bind one for the Mathom-house, and leave one here for the barn that it may speak when you are busy. If any man comes asking when bells are kept and whether ferries run for strangers at noon, your answer remains what it has always been. Only the paper now stands beside it and remembers when you are away.”

The steward smiled as a man smiles when something he has done every day is shown to be a better thing than he knew. “You will have tea before you go,” he said. “It is a poor clerk who writes on an empty stomach.”

They drank tea and ate a heel of bread and a slice of apple and spoke of weather and of a cow that had put its head through a hedge and then thought better of it. Then they rose and went up the lane toward the ford, taking the path that climbs to the low rise from which a man can see the water lie on its gravel like a cloth on a table. The last of the sun made the shoals show in pale cards; the ferrystone kept its small voice under the wind’s breath.

“It looks quiet,” Tomberic said. “It may not be.”

“Quiet is a way a place prepares to tell you something,” Tolly said. He laid the knot pages and the bar sketch side by side on the grass and put a small stone at each corner. Maralda set the tally sheet above them. They made no more than three hands of paper, and yet it had the feel of a map without names, the sort a man makes to remember the order in which things spoke to him.

“We will write the sentence that carries the weight,” Maralda said. She had a fresh square. “The ford and its approaches have, of late weeks, shown signs that men have tested and marked them in ways that can be read by sight and cord. These signs do not serve the river’s safety. We will continue to read and to write, and we ask our neighbours to keep the watches, not to answer unknown calls, and to remember that courtesies are better than tidy signals.” She read it back without flourish. “It is a dry sentence,” she added, “and that is its strength.”

On the road behind them a Ranger came at an easy walk. He had the dust of a day on his boots and the patience of a man who has had both kindness and trouble in equal measure. He greeted them by name and gave them the Greenway tidings in the manner of someone setting a dish on a table so that no one will knock it over by surprise.

“Two travellers were waylaid near the hollow south of the hedge‑oak,” he said. “They went on their way by morning with lighter packs and bruised opinions. We kept the news between the stones and ourselves. There is no use giving fright to folk who do not go that way.”

“And no one came by here with a tale about it,” Tomberic said. “That is a good sign.”

“Good,” the Ranger agreed. “Let it stay good. Keep your tokens short. If you must tell a day’s tale, choose split stick or notch, not both.”

“We have chosen,” Tolly said. “And we have chosen to add only what a Mayor or a Bounder can carry without tripping.” He tapped the sentence Maralda had written. “This will go to Michel Delving tonight by bells.”

The Ranger nodded, and his eyes went to the shoals and the reed beds where the bundles lay or did not, and then down to the bar where the small bright stones had been seen. “We have marked these places in our heads,” he said. “If your men at the Hay Gate must call us, they can do so by leaving the word at the fork‑crown willow. We will not be far.”

They stood together for a space and said nothing. A heron lifted from the far margin and went over without haste. The ferrystone whispered; the wind turned the pages just enough for Tolly to put his hand on them. It was the sort of quiet that stays with a man when he has gone home and finds his own door and his own kettle and his own chair.

“We will take the lower path,” Maralda said at last. “It is shorter to the road, and the paper will get to the Mayor sooner.”

“Go with water at your back and courtesy in your mouth,” the Ranger said, and turned downriver on his own business.

They carried the packet to a farm by the lane where the carrier from Waymeet liked to sit a little and hear news worth hearing. He read the dry sentence twice and said that it was good to be told enough and no more. He promised to be in Michel Delving by bells and to leave the paper at the Mayor’s office with the clerk whose hand was best at neat notices.

When they were alone again, Tomberic walked a little way off and stood with his back to the hedge and his face south. “I am not a man for grand reckonings,” he said when he came back, “but I can see that a loaf goes farther when people stop giving slices to passers‑by at night. If neighbourliness means lending stew and not giving away doors, I can keep neighbourly till winter.”

“That is the point,” Tolly said. He took up the knot pages and the bar drawing and shook them once to send any grass seed off. “We are mending the way we talk to one another as much as we are mending the ford. The ford will look after itself when we stop making easy things for tidy men to count.”

They went down into the lane as the light mellowed and the first kitchen smells began to steal out of doors and hedges. The river’s voice was too far now to be heard, but it seemed to walk with them in the way a word stays with you when you have learned it properly for the first time. At the corner where the lane turns, Maralda tapped her packet of papers so that they sat square in her satchel.

“When we are old,” she said, “and some child asks us how we kept a small place safe when the world beyond began to walk with heavier feet, we will show them that sentence and the little sketches. We will not tell them long stories. We will make a pot of tea and point at the words and say, ‘This was enough’.”

“Enough for now,” Tolly said, looking toward the ford where the last light lay on the water, “and more tomorrow.”
