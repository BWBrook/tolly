Fog lay thin as milk over The Water and drew in among the rushes till every stem wore a little halo. Tolly walked light along the Bywater Road with a basket on his arm and a letter from Auntie Wierdy tucked in his jacket, for cousins in Hobbiton must not be left without their share of pickled beets once the fields were emptied. It was a tidy morning after harvest, when the earth smells friendly and the lanes remember wheels.

He was not in a hurry, being a hobbit and no post‑runner, yet his feet went of their own accord to the bend where the lane skirts the pool. There the mill turned slow, and a chill came up from the water that made him pull his collar close and look, as he always did, for the big trout that held the shadow under the willow. The trout was there, and with it a scatter of fallen leaves that lay like small boats trembling in place. A crow called from The Hill and another answered from over Bywater way, so that the morning seemed to have a question and then an echo.

Tolly set down the basket on a clean stone and breathed the fog. The smell was of wet wood and old sacks and the faint sweetness of crushed apple. He thought of Auntie Wierdy’s stove and how she said, when the kettle went off at the wrong time, that bells in the Shire kept better hours than folk; and he smiled. There was kindness in a lane that met you the same each day, even if you had changed without noticing.

On the far side of the pool a reed stirred though no wind had yet come, and a thin note sounded that might have been a bird if it had not repeated in just the same way a moment later. Tolly straightened, listening. A reed‑whistle can be a game, and boys will call one another across water for the trick of it; but this was not quite a game’s call. It made three short sounds and then none. After a little, a boat‑hook knocked softly against wood, and the note came once more, as if asking.

He knew the tricks of the water as well as hedgerows, and he knew as well that a hobbit alone at morning should play no games with shadows. So he cleared his throat and said nothing, and the nothing was answer enough. The reed stilled. A small shape—perhaps only a duck, perhaps only a bundle of cut reeds—moved against the bank and was quiet.

“Whoever you are,” Tolly said at last, very mild, “you’ll get no fish by calling them.” Then he took up his basket and went on.

By the Haygate Stone, which keeps the memory of a field‑gate that stood there before his grandfather’s grandfather was a lad, he met Tomberic Greenback bringing a sack of barley on a barrow that had known better years. Tomberic greeted him with a lift of the chin and a grin that was all good nature.

“Morning to you, Tolly. Fog’s had a penny’s worth and left the rest,” he said. “Smells of apples yet.”

“And damp wool,” Tolly answered, for he had pulled his collar twice since the bend. “Are you bound for Hobbiton or the Dragon?”

“The mill first, the Dragon second, the road third, if the barley fetches what it ought,” Tomberic said. “There’s talk on the Greenway and I like to chase talk when my legs are free. Word is, travellers go in twos now, where once they went in ones for thrift. Some call it caution, some call it market talk to make things dear.”

“And what do you call it?”

“I call it a sign to keep a straight face and one eye open,” Tomberic said cheerfully. “There’s no call for a stir here, mind you. Only... well, crows count better than I do, and there’s more of them of an evening.”

They stood by the stone a moment, and the fog parted to show the pool lying grey and calm, with the mill‑tail making a faint lace where it ran. Tolly told him of the reed‑whistle and the soft knock of wood, and Tomberic’s grin went smaller but did not leave.

“Boys, or a fellow who likes to fish too early,” he said. “Or else a message for ears that aren’t yours or mine. I’ve heard a reed used for calling at night on the Greenway (three quick and one slow), but that was a winter ago and south of here. Best leave it to settle like silt. If it clears, you see bottom; if not, there’s no use muddying it.”

"I’ve no mind to muddy anything," Tolly said. “Only I think I’ll step by Michel Delving in a day or two. I’ve a question or two of my own for the Mathom-house, and a person there who knows how to count.”

"Maralda Bunce," Tomberic said promptly. "She can count how many peas there are in a pod without opening it. You give her my best."

Tolly nodded. He liked the way she made numbers into neighbourly sense and never dressed facts up for fair‑days. He could see, as if already there, her square hand setting a date in a corner and a sliver of red thread laid through it to say: to be saved.

They parted with good will. Tolly took the lane toward the Dragon and delivered Auntie’s beets to his cousin’s door, where he was drawn in to eat a heel of bread and cheese by the fire and to be told, as is the manner of cousins, that he looked thinner and taller and more like his father and when did he plan to settle down and would he take a pot of jam home? He submitted with patience and pockets improved, and at last came out again to the road, which had lost its first grey and taken on the weak gold that comes when the sun remembers its work.

He walked on past the pool and the mill, past The Hill with its well‑kept gardens, and turned aside to the stiles that look toward the fields. Leaves freckled the path. The Water flowed with the particular sound it has when harvest is done: as if the stream itself were full of straw and old stories. A waggon crossed the bridge with a rattle and a shout; smoke went up from Bagshot Row in three thin lines. None of it was strange, and that was a comfort.

At the stile nearest the hay meadows he paused again, for another crow called, lower now and nearer, and a second answered from the far hedge. He was not one for seeing omens in ordinary things, but he had learned, of late, to set a small mark in his mind beside such turns. He took out the stub of a pencil and a scrap of folded paper (for he kept small notes now, having found it wiser to trust a scrap than a memory when a year or more might come between the finding and the need) and he wrote: crows at dusk count; reed‑whistle, three short; soft knock on wood; no answer given; Haygate Stone; Tomberic’s talk of twos on the Greenway. He put the paper away and felt a little foolish for the care, and then not foolish at all.

At noon he ate under a hedge with his back to the sun and crumbs on his jacket, and a dog from the next field came to see if crumbs were the sort that travel. Tolly shared as far as manners allowed and sent the dog off full of opinions. When he stood, he looked once more at the water and saw a bit of twine caught on a snag—a twist of black and green. He reached with a stick and drew it in.

It was not much: a short length of cord such as might bind up a small parcel or a folded cloth. The colours were bright even with wet; the twist held tight. He rubbed it clean on his sleeve and turned it in his fingers. Plenty of twine in the Shire is brown or plain; some is dyed, where a tidy housekeeper likes a colour to tell a bundle by. But he thought of Tomberic’s talk, and of the reed‑whistle, and how the boat‑hook had knocked only once.

He put the twine with his pencil. “A thing found is a thing to be remembered,” Auntie Wierdy said, usually about lost buttons. He meant to remember it.

Toward evening he came again to the pool. The fog had gone and the water lay bare, showing the posts along the bank. The miller stood in his doorway wiping his hands and called a good‑evening. A boy ran past with a loaf under his arm and the world seemed just as it had always been, which is to say, worth keeping.

He crossed the bridge and took the road toward the Downs, meaning to sleep at a cousin’s in a lane off the Bywater Road and set out for Michel Delving in the morning. As he passed the Haygate Stone in the late light he set his hand upon it, as he had done since he was little, and he thought, not quite in words: gates keep things in and out, but there are gates you only feel when you are walking, and you know you have gone from one thing to another. He had a sense that he had put his foot on such a threshold.

In the falling light a crow came down to the field a little way off and picked among the stubble. It lifted its head as if listening to something not for him and then flew toward the east. Tolly watched it go, then turned his face toward the Downs and the quiet house where there would be stew and talk and a blanket, and a seat by the door where he could write down what he had seen before sleep.
