At first light the river wore a faint skin of mist, and the willows hung their pale leaves as if listening. Sarn Ford lies broad and quiet when it is in a friendly mood, the water drawing itself thin over the gravel so that the ground shows through like a well‑washed stone floor. Tolly stood where the bank makes a small shelf and felt the chill in his ankles, though his boots were dry. Tomberic was a few paces off, and Maralda behind them with her satchel closed, as one closes a book before the reading starts. Nathron came without show, as the evening had promised he would, and the morning took account of him without haste.

“We begin,” the Ranger said, “by letting the ford speak. The river keeps two kinds of tale: what lies under it, and what men lay upon it. If you learn the first, you are less often fooled by the second.”

He led them down to a place where the bank had been trodden by careful feet, and there a low blind of brush and turf crouched among the willow roots. It smelled of old leaves and faint smoke and iron kept oiled; it was a good smell for such a place, and it put no hurry in him, which he counted a mercy.

“Sit here when you are not walking,” Nathron said to Tolly and Tomberic. “Keep your lantern hooded at night and your patience unhooded by day. Count the beats between a ripple and its echo on the bank: that tells you more than it seems to. Watch the ferrystone, there.” He pointed toward the middle reach, where a squat, dark head showed when the water drew thin and went shy when a cloud’s shadow crossed. “It is set upon a low bed. When the river rises with a wind from the west, you will hear a change in its voice: a rougher whisper. If a man has shifted such a stone, he will not have shifted the bed beneath it. The voice betrays the meddler.”

Tolly listened. Rivers have names and moods; he had always known that in a Shire way, as one knows the difference between a kettle’s business and a pan’s. Now he tried to hear as Nathron heard. The water made small speakings: a chuckle where it met a root, a hiss where it slipped a narrow place, a thin lace sound over the shallows beyond the stone. He made a mark in his book: ferrystone voice (fair, thin), ripple to bank (two heartbeats), wind: west by a little.

“These bars here,” Nathron went on, drawing a line in the damp with a willow switch, “take the weight of a skiff if a fool tries them when the river is sulking. But a clever man will test where the pebbles lie new and where the sand is darker. Here, and here: you see?”

"I see," Tolly said; Tomberic nodded. Maralda’s pencil made a quiet scratch. She angled the square so that his eye could take the line as he heard it.

They walked ankle‑deep in clean cold just where the current would not pull a hobbit off his feet, and Nathron showed them the difference between a mark the river writes for itself and a mark men press upon it: a scuff where a pole had bitten too sharply; a notch on a post with tar in the grain; a place where cairn pebbles were too white by half. He said little and asked them to say what they saw, and so they learned twice.

“And when you are wrong?” Nathron asked suddenly, when Tolly had said that a faint V on the water argued for a shallow log and not a skiff.

“Then I say so as soon as I know it,” Tolly answered. “Better to be plain and put the right word in its place than to call the wrong one friend.”

"Good," said the Ranger. "The river is generous to men who will amend themselves." Maralda’s glance was brief and kind; the pencil kept its pace.

They took the blind for an hour, with Tomberic on the shelf below to watch the lower shallows where a man might pass if he did not care whether his knees were wet. The sun lifted and made the mist pale and then thin, and the willows stood more clearly one by one, like people in a crowd when the talk quiets.

Then a wake showed on the far side, so small a man might have named it a fish’s pride, but longer than a fish and set upon the water with a deliberateness that did not befit a creature without a thought for maps. Tolly’s pencil stopped. The wake came forward a yard’s breadth, then faded to nothing, then came again. A faint tap answered it from somewhere, wood to wood, not branch to branch.

Tomberic shifted, and Nathron’s hand, without looking, made a quiet stay‑sign. Maralda drew a slow breath as one takes a thread through a stubborn cloth.

The wake went over a patch where the gravel lies bright. There it told on itself, drawing a curved shadow where the light bends upon a hull. Not much of a hull: no more than a skiff. Tolly’s mouth went dry in that silly way the body has of taking the water away from a man when the world offers him little else to drink. He looked to Nathron.

“You will watch,” said the Ranger, “and not answer. You will count.”

Tolly counted the beats between the small tap and the little push of water on the willow root below the blind. He made a mark: tap to push, four. The skiff (if skiff it was) kept to the far shallows where a man who knew the ford would not try it when the river had altered its temper by so much as a day’s wind. It seemed to learn this truth late. The wake wavered, turned, and came upon a shoal with that modest insistence by which water persuades wood. A sound came then that is half complaint and half confession: the cry of a rope that has taken a load wrong.

“Hold,” Nathron said, and there was no danger yet in it, only the steadiness with which he named things. “Do you smell it?”

Tolly lifted his head. There is a tar smell in any place where boats keep their skin safe, but this was fresher than the post’s grain and closer than the blind’s oiled leather: a new sharpness, like a hearth rekindled after days of letting the ash lie.

“Tar, new,” Tolly said softly.

“Aye,” said Nathron. “And rope—hear it?”

This time the sound was only the chafe of fibres on a hard edge; it had more shame than complaint in it. Tolly put his hand on the post in front of the blind and felt where the grain had been bruised some while ago by an oar’s edge. He left his hand there, and when the small shove of water came up from the shoal he felt it through the wood: a faint tremor, like a cat walking upon a board out of sight.

“He will back her out,” Nathron said at last, “and he will tell himself that he has learned the ford. He has only learned the shoal. That is something, but it is not the thing he thinks it is.”

They watched the water clean its small disorder. The wake faded; a crow flew over and let fall a single call that had no meaning beyond itself; the ferrystone’s whisper kept to its thin voice. Tomberic climbed up to the blind and grinned without showing teeth.

“Near to a lesson for someone,” he said.

“For us too,” said Maralda, and wrote one line on her square paper: “Do not answer taps. Count them.”

They went down then to the post and looked at its oar‑scar. In the groove a faint thread of fibre had lodged, just a hair, pale as old straw. Tolly took it carefully on the point of a splinter and set it on a bit of paper to fold. He touched the tar without smearing it and wrote the hour against the touch.

“If you must leave a token,” Nathron said as they walked the bank, “set it where a man who knows to look will find it and a man who is greedy for knowing will pass it by. The fork‑crown willow will take a split stick at dusk. The hollow lane rail will take the notch you were shown. Use one or the other, not both, unless you wish to tell too long a tale.”

“One tale per day,” Tomberic said, “and let it be short.”

“Short and true,” Nathron agreed.

Through the morning they walked the ford’s edges and took its measure in their heads. Tolly made small neat drawings that would never show a stranger the ford but would show him, tomorrow, whether what he saw had changed. He learned to set his eye on a point of foam and walk it to the bank in thought, then look for the place where it must reach if his thought was honest. He was sometimes wrong by two paces, sometimes by one, and once by none; and he wrote those numbers down too, for truth keeps its own tally.

Toward noon a wind came low along the water and made the ferrystone’s voice rougher by a hair. Tolly heard it, and Nathron, without praise or chiding, tipped his head the same way and then went on reading the bars. In a quiet place where the shoal runs in like a tongue, there were three small pebbles too bright, set in a little row. Tolly looked and looked away and then looked again.

“Those stones did not wash here,” he said at last.

“No,” said Nathron. “Men’s hands. Take nothing; move nothing. The river will speak plainly enough to men who listen, if other men do not keep shouting over it.”

They ate bread in the blind and drank from a bottle that had been in the river a while to be cool. The day widened. Maralda slept like a cat for ten minutes with her hands folded; Tomberic told a small story about a fish he had not caught, which is the safest kind to tell; Tolly sat with the pencil dull in his fingers and breathed the smell of willow sap and water and a little tar, and thought how the Shire had many voices and this was one of them that few heard on purpose.

In the afternoon they walked the bank toward the token willow and set a split stick with two turns of plain brown twine, just as they had been bid. No more and no less. Then they took the hollow lane and stood by the old stile. Tolly ran his finger along the top rail and felt the old notches the Rangers knew by heart, and put none of his own there. There is a pride in not over‑telling.

On the way back a shepherd’s dog barked at them in the ordinary way of dogs. A heron rose and made three slow strokes and settled again. The day never made a drama of itself, and yet it went nearer to the bone than any tale told by a fire.

“We will come again by dawn,” Nathron said at last, when the light went from white to honey along the willows. “You will hear other voices in the river when the night has had its say. If there is a skiff that loves to test stones, it may come again after dark. You will still not answer it; you will still count.”

“We will count,” Tolly said.

They left the ford by the same path that had brought them, and at the fork‑crown willow they saw that the split stick was as they had left it, neither disturbed nor misunderstood. At the hollow lane there was nothing to say, and so they said nothing, which was also a good word.

At the small house where the watch kept its changes there was stew, and a place on a bench, and no more talk than a man needs who has kept his eyes open since dawn. Tolly laid the rope fibre on a clean page and put the page under a slate. He wrote the river’s small numbers again, not to be clever but to be sure. Maralda slid a spare square to the edge of his slate and left it there. Tomberic, who had a habit of whistling without thinking, did not whistle that night. Maralda tied her square papers with red thread and set them where smoke would not find them.

Before sleep Tolly went out and stood a little while where he could hear the river without being seen. Far off an owl called. Closer, a reed clicked in a way that might have been a beetle or a boy’s foolishness. He did not answer. He counted to ten and then to ten again, and when he had reached his own good number, he went inside and barred the door as a man does for custom as much as for safety. The water went on with its talking, which, being honest talk, did not need a reply.
