By sundown the ford wore a muffler of fog that drew itself in low along the shallows and left the banks bare. The willow under the slight bend threw a long, ragged shadow over the slack water; from there a man could look across and down the mid‑ford without showing much of himself. Nathron stood a pace back from the edge with his cloak turned so that the grey showed and not the brown. Tomberic had the shuttered lantern cradled like a loaf still warm. Maralda set a flat stone on her knees and laid out a folded square for notes. Tolly counted quietly under his breath, not out of nerves but to give the river its numbers before the night tried to take them.

“We do as we said,” the Ranger murmured, not to command but to settle the talk. “Lantern low, never still. No answers to unknown reeds. If a signal cannot be named, it is not ours.”

“Aye,” Tomberic said, soft as bread broken. “One swing only, and that a poor one.”

The ford has a way of speaking if you humour it. When the water slips over the thin ribs of gravel there is a hiss that tells of small stones and then, after a heartbeat or two, a gentle push against the near bank. Tolly liked to put a measure to such things; it made the world more willing to be read. He counted the span between hiss and push as the fog gathered and thinned again in slow breaths. The ferrystone told the same tale it had told at noon but in a lower voice, as if a cloth had been laid over its tongue.

“Wind’s turned a touch east,” Maralda said. “Smell it.” She lifted her chin and then looked to her page. “I’ll mark it down and the half‑quarter by the bells.”

From the south there came, faint and needling, a reed call: three short notes as boys make when the ice is thin and they want to look brave. The sound sat on the fog a moment and slid away. No one moved. A crow, somewhere beyond sight, clacked once and then again as if reckoning a sum. Tolly put a small tick on his own scrap—nothing written but a mark and the count beside it.

“Hold to our own light and our own proverbs,” Maralda said quietly, more to the page than to any of them. “By bells. By day. Name little, mark much.”

The reed spoke again, not quite the same, a hair slower as if a different mouth had it now. From farther off there came the faintest tap, not wood on wood but something like it, dull as from a wet stick against a post. Nathron’s eyes narrowed, then eased. “They test,” he said. “They think numbers will make them owners.”

“We can spare them a wrong number,” Tomberic said, and let the joke die where it lay. He eased the shutter back a finger to be sure of the hinge and then closed it again.

They had chosen their bar in daylight, walking the line of stones with boots in the damp and eyes for where the fog would take a light and set it down wrong. A harmless shoal lay above the true run, a place that showed teeth at low water and only smiled when the river rose. If a skiff turned its nose to that smile in fog, the worst would be a scrape and a scold from a rope.

“On your count,” Nathron said, never above the size of the place.

Tolly listened again. Hiss. One‑two. Push. He let the measure take him twice more, and at the third he touched Tomberic’s sleeve. The lantern breathed once as the shutter cracked and a small, low light drew a crooked line no higher than a hedge‑pig’s back along the fog. It shivered, as if unwilling to be a beacon, then winked shut. Tolly smelled hot oil and felt the night lean to listen.

 A beat, and then another, and then there was the faintest change on the far face of the ford as if something darker than dark had turned its side. A wake showed without a boat to own it, just a smear of gloss where the water smoothed, and then the soft rasp of a rope drew along some hidden edge. The sound went to the bone the way such sounds do when a man’s mind has learned them by a hard lesson.

“There,” Nathron said—not pointing, only setting the word in the air where each could lay a sight to it. “They’ve taken the smile.”

A horn spoke far to the south, not bold, just two low notes that kept their own counsel. The fog shifted with the sound as if the river had breathed. Three crows rose together from the invisible margin and flapped off east in a shape that looked almost like a hand opening and closing. The wake slowed where the bar grew shallower, and a dull scrape came, then a sigh as from a rope eased when a man decides he will rather save the cord than the day.

“No pursuit,” Nathron said, and the words did not need agreeing. The Shire’s side was a gate you did not throw wide for curiosity.

When the water settled the four of them stepped down to the mid‑ford where a rag of tar had blacked a splintered stake. There a small thing showed under the thin skin of flow: a neat packet caught in a snarl of root and reed where the willow’s toes went to drink. The packet was wrapped in waxed cloth and bound once with plain cord, once again with a thin thread of black and green, which made Tomberic’s mouth tighten without any speech. He set his knife to the cord but did not cut it; instead he slid the loop whole over the end and set it on Maralda’s flat stone.

“Chain of hands,” Maralda said. She dried her fingers carefully and took out a length of red thread from her satchel. She tied it with a tidy turn above the old knot. “Sight and copy first; open later where a table keeps its temper. We do not rummage on the bank.”

Tolly worked the tar scrap free with a stick and set it by. It was the size of a man’s thumb and carried a grit of sand and one pale hair from a rope laid in tar too hastily. He wrote without fuss: “By sundown; fog; one swing lantern low; wake on smile; two‑blast horn far south; crows three east; tar rag with grit; pouch recovered at willow root; thread black‑and‑green; cord plain; red thread added; no pursuit.” He did not put guess to paper. He had learned that guesses breed when fed and then they run about the house.

“Let me see your times,” Nathron said. He looked down the line of Tolly’s figures and nodded once. “Good. The ferrystone lost half its voice at the last breath before your swing. They were already within their own count. We did not catch them; we turned them.”

Fog makes distances feel like lies. For a while it seemed as if the south bank drew closer and then slipped away although no one moved. Maralda tucked the packet into a cloth and numbered it plainly: 12 on one corner, the day sign beside, the hour by bells. She looked toward the willow crown. “Set the token, Tolly,” she said, and there was the smallest warmth in the way she said his name, as if a count kept truly were a kindness done. “We have said what we would say to this watch.”

At the fork‑crown willow a man who knows the craft can make the branch say small things to those who know how to hear. Tolly took the split stick and set it in the place where the bark parted naturally. Beneath the split he tied a plain loop loose enough to mean “wait on the look.” Above it he set the small tight turn Nathron had taught him for “double the watch by dawn and dusk,” though that knot had been given already after the wolf‑sign; better to speak twice than not at all when the river sits lower. He stepped back and checked that nothing shouted to an idle passer‑by.

“By bells,” Tomberic said, as if making a toast none of them wished to drink twice. “We carry the packet by bells in the morning. No talk on the road.”

“No talk at all to those who do not need it,” Nathron answered. “Name little. Mark much. If someone calls with a reed, be stone.”

They went the length of the bank within the willow’s shadow and checked where the mid‑ford deepened to the knee. The water made a lace that the eye could read once the lantern’s breath had been forgotten. Twice Tolly caught sight of a smear in the sand where a skiff’s nose had pressed testing, light and uncommitted, as a fox puts a paw to a stile. The smears told him someone south would be mending a rope tonight and not boasting of his seamanship to any master.

They did not pry the packet. Maralda only weighed it in her palm and listened to its small hush, as if whatever lay inside had its own wish to be quiet. She wrapped it again in a square and set it at the bottom of her satchel where the red thread showed. “If it is more cord and knots, we shall know their manner better,” she said. “If it is paper, we will copy without flourish and keep the hand entire. Either way, the Mayor will have a plain sentence and the Mathom-house a thing numbered and clean.”

“And the watch?” Tomberic asked.

“Keeps,” Nathron said simply. “We will be two at the first light, three if the fog holds and the river keeps her cloth on. If they count us, let them count wrong.”

The fog, which had thickened after the horn, began to draw back from the shoals as if the river were bored with being that careful. From somewhere up the Greenway a cart’s rattle came faint over the low ground, and a dog barked twice at nothing anyone wished to chase. The willow leaves made a dry whisper. Tolly found he was hungry though he had done nothing but listen and write; that is the way of certain kinds of work.

They took their bite near the watch‑house: a heel of bread shared into four, and a bit of cheese that had travelled well in a pocket. When the crumbs were brushed off the flat stone, Tolly wrote the clean ledger lines that would sit under steam until morning. Maralda held the board steady without being asked; their fingers kept politely to the corners while the pencil spoke for both:

“By sundown fog lay low. Lantern one swing low near mid‑ford; no steady light shown. Unknown reed calls ignored. Wake took shoal; scrape heard; horn two blasts far south. Three crows rose and went east. Recovered: tar rag with grit; one wax‑cloth packet with plain cord and black‑and‑green thread; red thread added; contents unopened. Token: tight turn set; loose loop below. Wind east a hair; ferrystone low by a finger. No pursuit.”

He set the page under the slate in the corner where steam did not fret it and tied his pencil to the shelf with a bit of string, having learned how pencils love to roll away when a man’s back is turned. Maralda set the cup by his elbow and, without making a business of it, said, “Well counted,” in the tone one uses for work that need not be praised to be valued.

“We should sleep while the river does not mind us,” Maralda said. “Dawn is a tidy teacher when a man is not woolly.”

“I’ll take first while the fog finishes its fuss,” Tomberic offered. “Wake me when the kettles on the south begin to pretend there were never any kettles there.”

Nathron smiled at that and took the hinge of the door in his hand. “Wake him when the hush changes,” he said. “A watch that hears its own habits keeps better than one that listens for someone else’s music.”

Tolly stepped out one last time to the line where the willow shadow ended. The ford lay quiet and older than their little tricks, and he felt the smallness of what they had done and the rightness of it both together. The water had its old paths; the stones had their uses; their work was only to keep the tale of them from being bent by men who counted at the wrong hour. He put his palm to the bark and thought of Auntie Wierdy who would have said that mending a thing before it tears is the laziest labour any sensible person should strive for. He smiled at the thought and went in.

The night did not turn into a song. It turned into the kind of quiet that gives back small answers to those who ask in the proper voice. Somewhere south a bird called once and thought better of it. The fog slipped and gathered and slipped again. The river kept the ford. That was all, and enough.
