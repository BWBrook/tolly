At first light the ford wore a colour that is not a colour so much as a patience: the pale between night and day when stone keeps its own counsel and water seems to think about itself before moving. The willow‑holt stood with its toes in the slow shallows and its crown ragged like a farmer’s hair on a busy morning. Nathron was already there, quiet as a stake set long ago. Two Bounders came by the hollow lane with sacks over their shoulders and hands that smelled faintly of oil and chalk. Tomberic had a coil of rope that did not intend to be used for any brave thing. Maralda carried her flat board and a roll of square paper. Tolly came last, because he had stopped to look once at the ferrystone in the grey and listen to its voice.

“At first light,” Nathron said, as if naming an old custom. “No shouting, and nothing done that a man could not call maintenance if asked.” He smiled with a corner of the mouth. “The river remembers good manners better than ceremonies.”

“We will tidy what was untidy,” the elder Bounder answered. “And put the chalk where it belongs.” He lifted the sack and the smooth clack inside told of small bright stones waiting to be bagged in their turn.

They walked the ford’s edge in a bent line, keeping to the willow’s shadow where the bank allowed. The ferrystone showed its knuckled back by a finger more than yesterday; the water over the ribs made a lace like old linen. Tolly set his measure in his head: hiss, one‑two, push; then the shorter span where the bar narrows and the sound tightens.

“Read me your times,” Nathron said. Tolly spoke the counts and the little changes, and the Ranger matched them with his own. “Good,” he said. “Your numbers and the river’s are on speaking terms.”

At the willow‑holt the wrong bar showed itself with the insolence of a man who has borrowed another’s hat and thinks it fits him. A string of bright stones lay like beads in a line that had no business being there. Thumb‑marks marred the small caps on two of the little cairns. Farther out, where the water lifted and laid itself down again, a single pebble too fair for this reach winked and then drowned and then winked again.

“We take them as they lie,” Maralda said. “No making a lesson of it for the wind.”

Tomberic set his rope and waded to the knee where the bar lifted. He did not lift the stones with drama. He set them in the sack as if they were misplaced buttons from a good coat and each worth the bother of saving. The Bounder on the near bank held the mouth for him and counted softly, because counting calms the fingers and leaves the mind clear.

Tolly worked along the nearer edge with a small stick and a steadiness he had learned this last year: small touch to a finger‑pressed cap; look for the print of the last hand; drop the cap into the sack if it told the wrong tale; let the river keep as much of itself as it could. “Here,” he said once, and Maralda stepped in to see a smear of tar gone dull on a low stake. She wrote: “tar, old; smear thin; not fresh; still tells a habit.” She took a flake with the tip of a knife and set it on her board and tied it with red thread in case a man asked a small question later that needed a small proof.

“We will keep to the craft of tidying,” Nathron said. “No show.” He lifted one bright stone between finger and thumb as if apologising to the river for having to move it at all, then dropped it into the sack and watched the water rub away its borrowed shine.

Where the bar ran out toward the deeper run there was a point of sand that had tried to be clever and taken the shape of a nose. A small twig leaned there, not by wind but by a hand that had wanted a sign without a cairn. Tomberic looked, then shook his head. “We’ll lean a twig the other way where the true run begins,” he said. “Not a trap; a help for eyes that belong to us.”

The work made a rhythm before any of them named it. Tolly liked rhythms because they put gentleness into tasks that could grow sharp if a man did them all out of his mind and not out of his body. Maralda saw it too, and because hobbits will sing when a job finds its stride, she hummed and then gave words to the hum, soft so that only those who belonged to the ford could hear:

> With a sack by the stone and the dawn on the bar,
> We set what is ours where our own markers are;
> Keep low, keep slow,
> Let the river know.

> With a hand to the rope and a mind to the line,
> We gather the bright and we leave what is fine;
> No boast, no blow,
> Let the river flow.

Tomberic grinned at the rhyme’s good foot and did not try to make it louder. The elder Bounder’s mouth moved as if he were keeping time with a proverb. Nathron, who did not sing, inclined his head the way a man does when a thing is done in its proper key. Tolly kept the count; her tune found it and made it kinder.

They followed the wrong bar to its timid end and found one last bright pebble tucked where a skiff’s nose would scrape if it kept to the false count. Tomberic reached, and Tolly set his hand under Tomberic’s wrist without thinking, to steady the move so the river would not be given any excuse for a fuss. The pebble came free and showed a bit of cord tar‑stiffened and stuck under it. Tolly lifted it with the stick and held it out.

“Plain cord,” he said, “but it learned bad habits.”

Maralda set it on the board and tied a red thread to it. She wrote: “cord, plain; tar‑touch; likely from stake; found at bar end.” Then she drew a quick map: before, with the bright line and its thumb‑capped tops; after, with the bar shown as the river had always preferred it. Her hand made no flourish. She set small marks to show where the twig would lean at the true run.

They came again to the ferrystone and stood where its rough back took the early light. Tolly read it with his fingers and thought of the nights when false numbers in fog had tried to teach it a new song. “It keeps its voice,” he said. “A finger lower than yesterday’s noon, not much. No scrape fresh.” He did not say, as he had in his pocket notebooks, that the stone felt like something that would rather be left to its old work than asked to learn a cleverness by strangers.

“Set your twig,” Nathron told Tomberic. “Small, and where a ferryman would expect to find a friend. No more.”

Tomberic chose a length of willow no thicker than a pencil and leaned it with the point set landward, just where the true run takes a mind to gather itself. It looked like something a thoughtful man might have left without wanting thanks.

They bagged what should never have been set and took a last walk along the water. The sacks felt oddly heavy for a thing so bright and so little. The elder Bounder hoisted his and laughed under his breath. “Stones,” he said, “are like words: light when you throw them about, and much heavier when you pick them up again where they ought not to be.”

"Before and after," Maralda said, showing her two small drawings side by side. “This is enough for the Mayor and for Mossfoot’s ledger. The rest we can keep in our hands and our habits. If a man asks what we did, we can say we tidied the ford and checked the bar and set a twig for the ferry’s sake. All true.” She met Tolly’s eye a moment, as if to say that numbers and neighbourliness had kept step.

“And if a man asks whether we meant to spoil anyone’s numbers,” the Bounder said drily, “we can say we prefer apples to sums.”

“Then we should have an apple,” Tomberic said, and produced two from whatever corner of his gear apples live in when Tomberic travels. He gave them out without making a show of charity. Men work better when their mouth remembers sweetness as well as caution.

They took the sacks by the hollow lane so that any eye on the far bank would see nothing that looked like a parade. At the fork‑crown willow Tolly set the split stick true and changed the knot: no tight turn this time, for the doubled watches belonged to fog and a lower river; the loose loop remained for “wait on the look,” and beneath it he tied a simple straight tie meaning only “all watches as posted.” He showed the boy, who had come up from the post with a pair of nimble hands, how to make that one without thinking too hard about it, and the boy made it and unmade it once with a solemnity that was comic and proper at the same time.

Back at the board the elder Bounder took his chalk and wrote a line that kept its back straight: “At first light: bar cleared of bright stones; cord/tar to post; twig set at true run; ferrystone steady; rota window posted.” He marked two dots for the hours when the joint work had been done, and put the chalk back. Nathron scribed the same on his small strip in a spare hand.

The sacks, two of them, were emptied into an old grain bag and tied off. “We’ll give these pretties to a garden path where they can be trod on and forget they were ever meant for mischief,” the Bounder said. “They can shine where shining belongs.”

“And the cord?” Maralda asked.

“Post keeps it,” Nathron said. “Red thread on it to say it belongs to telling, not to use. If a cousin asks for string, he can have something that never thought to know tar.”

They went once more to the water because it is wise, when you mean to leave a thing alone, to look at it after the last hand is off it. The river said nothing notable; the ferrystone kept counsel; the willow leaves made their dry whisper. A crow came down to the far bank, stepped about foolishly, and then lifted away east with an air of being late for a meeting no one else attended.

“That is enough,” Nathron said. “If there are men who think to set sums against our habit, they will find emptier fingers and stones that have convinced themselves to be honest. Keep your compact and your courtesy, and they will have less to count.”

Tolly wrote the clear ledger lines before the day warmed: “At first light; wrong bar cleared; finger‑press caps removed; bagged bright stones; tar‑smear thin; plain cord with tar‑touch bagged and red‑threaded; twig leaned at true run; ferrystone steady; token set: watches as posted.” Maralda read them and added one small word with her pencil, “joint,” before “hands,” and he liked that better than any longer sentence. Then, because he could not help it and because a ledger need not be deaf, he added on his scrap: “Work done in the manner of mending; river left to its old road.” He folded the scrap where it would not show to anyone who cared more for numbers than for roads.

By the time the sun admitted to being up, the ford looked as it had looked for years: a place with a habit and no appetite for being clever. The men looked as men do who have done work that will make little noise now and save much noise later. They parted with courtesy and small jokes about apples and chalk. The willow‑holt, relieved of its borrowed trinkets, moved very slightly in a breeze and seemed to be thinking of nothing that a ledger would need to hold.
