Morning had the look of metal rubbed thin over the river. The ford lay plain; the shallows stitched their small white thread where the ribs showed, and the ferrystone kept its knuckled back the height it ought. Tolly crouched at the ford overlook and set his palm on the old post to feel whether the day had a tremor in it. It did not. He counted the hiss and the push the way a man says grace before eating, from good habit and not from fear.

“Steady,” he said, when Tomberic came up with a coil of rope that had no ambition. “A finger lower than yesterday’s noon, maybe, but not so as to give a proud skiff any reason to strut.”

Maralda noted it without flourish. “Steady,” she wrote, and put a small bar under the word to show the river’s tone rather than its measure. The boy with the chalk, promoted in his own mind to keeper of boards, stood on his toes and peered past Tolly’s shoulder as if the water itself might read the word and approve.

Down at Sarn Ford the ferryman came along the plank, a can of oil in one hand and a rag in the other, with the contentment of a man who has found a job that only needs time and neatness. He nodded to the elder Bounder and to Nathron, who had appeared at first light as if the willow had decided to grow a man for the morning. The Ranger had a strip of paper under his thumb and a look that counted well and hurried nothing.

“No new cairns,” the Bounder called softly, not to wake anything that might be sleeping out of season. “No thumb‑marks on caps. Your twig sits like a thought a ferryman would have had without us.”

“Good,” Nathron said. “We keep courtesy; we keep watches; we keep the truth of the bar.” He smiled a little and did not tire it.

They made their courtesy rounds in a short half‑hour. The elder Bounder rubbed the rota board with a damp rag and set a clean edge to the chalk marks; the boy rewound the chalk’s string with the seriousness of a man binding a book. At the fork‑crown willow Tolly touched the token that meant “all watches as posted” and left the loose loop where it was, for waiting is not laziness when a gate is in view. On the post by the board a small thing had been left in the night: a short length of plain cord tar‑touched and tied about with a thread of red. No one had seen the hand that brought it; the Bounder set it in the corner by the ledger slate and, with a piece of chalk, wrote: “cord returned.”

“Someone’s figures went wanting,” Tomberic said, and did not seek to know whose. He offered the ferryman two apples without ceremony, and in return received the promise of a dab of tar for the plank when the sun stood higher. “You cannot beat a fair trade for keeping peace,” he observed, and the ferryman laughed softly as if that proverb had been waiting to be said all morning.

By mid‑day Nathron brought out the strip he had kept under his thumb and added a few words in a spare hand.

“A message,” he said. “Plain as a fence rail; no names; no boasting.” He read it so that all could carry it whole: “False cairns removed; cord and tar set by unknown hands collected; twig leaned at true run; ferrystone voice steady. Compact posted at Hay Gate and overlook; countersign by proverb; escorts by day only. No reeds answered. Keep the watches.” He folded the strip again and sealed it with a bit of wax that kept no crest, only a thumb’s truth.

A rider from farther south, who had come by the Greenway with no wish to be admired, stepped out of the shade and took the strip as a man takes a loaf, grateful and not making poetry of it. “I will carry it,” he said. “If there is more to be said it will be said in the same size.” He bowed in a way that gave no one any reason to bow back more than once, and was gone between the hedges with the calm of a man riding along a line he already knew.

In the afternoon a skiff showed where the river broadens shyly before the ford, a low thing with a parish bundle in the middle and a man who had the look of somebody who had been told old stories of rivers and had decided to believe only half of them. He had come by day, as a decent fellow does when he is new to a place; a Bounder walked the bank with him, no more command than a friendly company, and the ferryman gave a small lift with the pole where the true run gathers itself. The skiff made the crossing without scrape or pride. The man raised his hat; the Bounder put a dot on the board and the very short word “escort” beside the hour.

A reed called later, thin and hopeful from the far side, three short and one longer, as if someone had been told it would work and wished to report success. The wind gave it back in tatters and nobody answered. The boy listened with a face like a young clerk finding an error that would ruin no one’s supper and then went back to his business of trimming the board’s ragged paper edge.

“Some lessons end by not being taught,” Maralda said. “I prefer that sort.”

They walked the overlook again toward late light. The willow‑holt wore a gloss like good iron; the bright stones that had been taken away from their bad manners shone a little in the sack where the elder Bounder had put them, ready to become a garden path in some place where shine belongs. Tolly read the ferrystone once more because he does not trust a day that has gone too kindly to keep its shape at the last. It spoke the same word it had spoken in the morning.

“It holds,” he said simply.

“Then we may go home by hedges,” Tomberic answered. “If we take the lane that minds the hay‑house, we can smell the apples even if we never so much as eat one.”

"We will carry the Mayor’s copy and Mossfoot’s,” Maralda said. “By bells tomorrow, and the ledger will stand a little straighter for the weight.” She tied her fresh copy with the same small neatness that had become her habit as surely as Tolly’s pencil had become his, then reached without fuss to settle the strap of his satchel so it would not rub. He said “By bells,” and she answered with a look that needed no word.

Toward evening the ferryman oiled his oars, the kind of labour that looks like idleness if you do not know the price of dry wood. The boy swept the dirt from the foot of the post and, seeing that the board’s edge had begun to feather a little with being read, took out his knife and trimmed it tidy, no flourish, no whittling, only the care that keeps a thing from becoming shabby for want of a minute. The elder Bounder made his mark on the rota where the dots meet and shook his head once at a thought that had tried to make itself important and failed.

“If there are men counting, let them count this,” he said. “A cart in its lane; a plank with oil where it needs it; a board whose words are short; and a river that knows its own mind.”

They took the hedge path that keeps a man on good terms with thorns. From the rise you can see the ford and, beyond it, a grey slice of the south country going on about its business without telling you exactly what that business is. The breeze came up out of the west with the smell of cut grass and a little of the damp place under the willows. Crows went to their beds in a sensible way, in small knots and without sermon.

By sundown they stood again at the Hay Gate. The post kept its board as it had in the morning; the chalk swung once and was still. Tolly set his scrap on the shelf in the watch‑house and wrote in a hand that does not dawdle: “Ford holds; warnings sent south; watches keep.” He added the hour and a small mark like a leaf so that anyone who had watched as long as he had would know whose shorthand it was without any pride being harmed by the knowing.

Tomberic set a coil of rope on the peg where rope likes to hang and does not kink itself for mischief. Maralda slipped the copies into her satchel under the red thread and nodded to the boy, who had been pretending not to wait for such a nod since he had got up. Nathron touched the brim of a hat that might have been anyone’s and looked south the way a man looks at a road he does not own and will nevertheless keep safe by courtesy.

“We have taken nothing from the river it would not thank us to remove,” he said. “We have added nothing it did not already prefer.”

“And we have left a sentence where men can see it when their minds go woolly,” the Bounder added, tapping the board. “That is honest work.”

They parted without ceremony. The ford, having been minded with small hands and short words, went on making its own music. The willow leaves shook themselves once like a dog coming out of water, and then the hush came back that belongs to places which are not lonely but do not wish to be crowded with talk. The road to Michel Delving lay the way it always had, and the hedges were in a mood to be kind to travellers who understood that kindness often looks like a stile in good condition and a gate that does not stick.
