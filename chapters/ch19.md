By bells the steps of the Mathom-house held their cool, as if stone can remember shade better than sun. The sound from the square below climbed up and thinned: cart talk and gossip to do with apples and an aunt who had promised jam and had delivered stories instead. Maralda came up the last rise with Tolly and Tomberic, and Mossfoot was waiting in the doorway with the look of a man who has learned not to look surprised when ordinary things bring news.

“By bells,” he said, because it is proper to greet a ledger by its hour. “If you have brought the sort of nothing that proves something, you may come in.”

They went through the long room where the old buckles and the bounders’ staves hang their sleep, and into the ledger chamber where the ink keeps the Mayor company. The air had a smell of paper and patience. Maralda put her satchel on the table and untied the red thread on the first packet with the care one gives to a thing that has learned its own worth by being carried. She set a small square on the table: a clean map copy of the ford’s bars, “before” and “after”, dots for bright stones in the first, a plain run in the second, twig marks for the true line. Her hand had made it plain and not clever.

“Map copy,” she said. “Witnessed by Nathron; to be kept with the ford notes. Square hand; no flourishes.”

Next she laid down the knot primer: loops and ties shown in small drawings with their meaning written to the side in a way a ferryman’s fingers would understand faster than his eyes. End knot for attention; double for bells; loose loop for wait; tight loop for go; tail‑tuck for left; fork for right; straight tie for all watches as posted; the tight turn for doubled dawn and dusk when the river sits lower. Tolly tapped each with a pencil as if the touch would fix it more firmly in the world.

“Knot primer,” he said. “Learned by practice; not secret; to be shared with bound posts and ferry folk.”

The tar scrap came next, flaky now and tied about with a thread of red, and beside it a short length of plain cord that had met tar against its will. A small note in Maralda’s square hand went with them: “Found at bar’s end; likely from stake; kept to answer small questions.” Mossfoot read the note and nodded in that way a man does when he is grateful to be spared a speech.

“All this,” Mossfoot murmured, “fits with what my nose thought it knew and what my knees thought about the river in fog. I like it better on the table.” He turned to Tolly. “And you, lad, do you bring the day in a line?”

Tolly set out the short ledger sentences he had kept in his pocket book and transcribed them into the town volume while Mossfoot watched the neatness of the pen more than its speed. “By sundown fog lay low. Lantern one swing low; no answers to reeds. Wake took shoal; horn two notes south. Packet recovered and sealed. Watch tokens set as posted.” Then the day later: “False cairns removed by joint hands; twig leaned at true run; ferrystone steady. Cord and tar collected. Compact posted. Escorts by day only. Keep the watches.” And yesterday: “Ford holds; warnings south; boards tidy.”

Tomberic stood with his hat in his hands, a rare thing for Tomberic, and only smiled in a way that said this room liked quiet jokes. He set a small bag of bright pebbles on the table and said, “Garden path.” Mossfoot grinned and said the Mayor’s wife would be pleased to see shine in a place where shine belongs.

“We will lodge the copies in order,” Maralda said, her voice turning from road to record without losing itself. “Mayor’s sentence in the civic book; ford packet in the Mathom-house ledger drawer; one square posted at the Hay Gate and one at the overlook already; this primer to be taught by hand to those who need it and not to those who like cleverness for its own sake.”

The Mayor came in while she spoke, with dust on his cuffs and a mind for short talk. He set his name with a plain mark on the line that said “received and entered by bells.” He was a man who trusted things to hold if you give them the right drawer and the right hour, and he preferred his drawers labelled and his hours rung.

“We do not make a parade,” he said, which was as much oration as the room would suffer. “The posts already tell the folk what they need, and the ferryman will teach any honest hand to tie what talk cannot teach. I am glad of your red thread.” He tapped it as if it were a small banner fit for this house and no other. He looked from Maralda to Tolly and back. “You keep tidy company between you. The town does well by it.”

They went out to the steps to let the ink dry. The square kept its afternoon in a sensible fashion. A child ran across with a pretend sword and a piece of string at his wrist tied in two colours. “That is for counting,” he told another, solemn with the importance of being seen doing a thing properly. Over by the well a woman said to her neighbour that the leaf‑banner in the west room looked less of a rumour these days and more of a thing that can anchor talk without starting fights. It was the sort of sentence Michel Delving says when it has decided to remember something.

“We will send a copy to the Mathom-house’s country drawer,” Mossfoot said. “And a note to the Hay Gate: ‘Boards stand; rota holds; no answers to reeds; day only for strangers at the ford.’ That last line is as old as good sense.”

“Old things like to be said as if they were new once in a while,” Tomberic replied. “It keeps them from sulking.”

They went back in, and Maralda tied the red thread on the packet one last time and wrote on the corner, small and square: “Sarn Ford, SR 1417; bar cleared; compact posted; knot primer taught; ‘Keep the watches’ relayed.” She set it in the drawer that holds river things: ferry receipts from winters that tried to break boats; a list of repairs done to the plank when a freshet unsettled the nails; a thin stone that once sat on a shelf in a ferryman’s shed and remembered the shape of boots. She did not handle those. It is impolite to wake old objects without cause.

Mossfoot took the civic book and gave it its place with the weight of a man who respects paper when it has been honest. “This will stand for what it needs to stand for,” he said, not grandly. “If anyone from south asks whether the ford is left to chance, we will say it is left to courtesy, which is a stronger keeper.”

Tolly stood a moment in the doorway and let the square fill his eyes: steps dipped in the middle by many careful feet; a boy being taught to carry a bucket with both hands and not to slop; a cart that had decided to creak only when asked; bells counting an hour with no hurry. In his pocket, folded once and then again, lay the scrap where he wrote for himself and not for drawers. He looked at it and, because a man may keep a private sentence without betraying a public one, he wrote under the last neat line: “There and back by hedge and stone.” He made the letters small enough that they would not quarrel with the other business. Maralda, seeing him fold the paper away, offered a fresh square from her satchel with a sliver of red thread through the corner. “For the next errand,” she said, as if the world had quietly agreed there would be one.

“Home?” Tomberic said, as if the word were a place as well as a roof.

“Home,” Tolly agreed. “By the lane that minds the hay‑house.”

They left Mossfoot and the Mayor to their drawers and their bells. The steps down were cool; outside, the square had warmed to its late light and a smell of apples and clean buckets. The talk ran on but not about them. That was for the best. They would carry their small boast inward, where boasts belong if they are to keep from souring. Without needing to speak of it, they turned toward the same road out of town and set their feet to one pace.

At the door, where the sun and the room meet and are polite to each other, Tolly looked once over his shoulder. The Mathom-house kept its ordinary light as if it had been built to teach ordinary to any thing that came in too proud. The pages would go quiet and the red thread would cease to look like a ribbon and become a tag again. Outside, the lanes were bright, and the boards at the posts would go on telling the same short words until they were not needed and then, perhaps, telling them still, because good words like to work even when they have nothing left to carry.
