The bell at Michel Delving counted the hour with its plain, homely note, and the sound went down the chalk lanes and along the green shoulders of the White Downs like water being poured. Maralda Bunce, who minded the numbers for the Mayor and kept certain quiet tables for the Mathom-house besides, shut the office window against the drift of dust and turned a heavy ledger toward the light. There was no hurry; there seldom was, not by the bells; yet something in the neat columns asked for second seeing.

It was only leaf and lading on the page: farm names, cart weights, the small give‑and‑take of Shire life, and then, beside three bales bound for Longbottom stores, a mark she did not recall setting eyes on before. It was not a letter as hobbits write, nor a tidy figure. The wax next to the clerk’s neat hand had been pressed with a broad palm, and the string that had bit the seal showed a thread of black and green, twisted together. The clerk had copied it faithfully in the margin with his best pen, as clerks do when they are not certain whether to name a thing or only notice it.

“A buyer’s seal,” Maralda said to herself, and said nothing more, for talking to an empty room sets bad habits at the door. She set her finger to the tally, then to the next, and saw the same sign upon a second leaf‑lot, and once again a fortnight later. Three is a crowd in a ledger, when two would be chance.

Outside, the Mathom-house kept its cool even in late sun. The steps were worn by years of small feet and careful hands, and within lay those considered trifles that are only trifles to the unknowing: old buckles and bounders’ staves, a shard of painted thing from the Tower Hills, a child’s toy cart made of ash and iron nails black with age. It was a place for memory, not meddling. Maralda liked it so, and yet the sound of crows at evening, which had grown louder of late over the Downs, came back to her as she stood in the doorway and watched the square.

A carrier from Waymeet had brought, with his bread and news, a Ranger’s word two days past: travellers on the Greenway went now in twos when they could; a pack of wolves was heard some miles south and once seen at distance, and a light on the downs had burned late on a wind‑spite night. Such tales drifted in and out like market smoke; the Shire, being itself, folded them into talk and set the kettle on. Still, there was the mark in the book, and the string’s odd colour, and the way crows turned at dusk as if counting hedges. Small things, each; yet small things add.

Maralda dipped her pen and began a tidy note on square paper. She did not write what she suspected; she only set down what was before her eyes: three bales with a broad‑handed seal and black‑and‑green twine; dates; the names of carters who had touched the goods; the clerk’s initials; the matter stored by the bells at Longbottom. She sanded the page, blew the grit, folded it once, and tied it up with a sliver of red thread such as the Mathom-house used to mark “to be saved.”

There was a young fellow north in the Greenfields who had a mind like a well‑kept drawer, where you might put a thing and find it again in spring without fuss. He had turned up last year with an arrowhead and a tale that proved older than the telling, and the Mayor, who listened more than he let on, had seen fit to see him twice since. Maralda put his name on the outside, Tolman Noakes (though most called him Tolly), and added, after a pause, only this: by bells, if you please. She liked the way his notes kept to plain truth and left room for a neighbour’s sense.

She stepped out under a sky thinning toward evening, and the square smelled of dust and apples. A crow cut the air over the White Downs and slid east. The bell in the Mayor’s office sounded again. Maralda locked the ledger in its drawer and the note in her pocket, and went down the steps of the Mathom-house, where the stone is dipped in the middle by so many years of careful feet.
