The hedge at Hay Gate was high as a house and thick with thorn, and the lane there narrowed so that a cart and a walker must mind their manners when they met. By sundown the leaves on the quickset shone like small coins, and the westering light lay along the road as if someone had spilled honey and left it. Tolly and Tomberic came up the last rise with their breath steaming faint as milk, and they could hear the Brandywine farther off than the eye could reach: a broad hush, as of a giant sleeping.

Two Bounders kept the post at the gate that day, with staves polished by years of hands and a cooking‑pot that smelled of onions and rosemary. They were civil, and kindly to folk who came with bread to share, which Tomberic, being Tomberic, produced from his sack almost before greetings were done.

“Evening to you,” said the elder, a square fellow with hay in his hair and patience in his jaw. “If you’ve come for a look over the hedge, know that we keep watch both ways these days. It’s a fine evening for it, and not so fine either.”

“We came to bring what we have and take what tidings there are,” Tomberic said, and Tolly added that they would pass on any word to Michel Delving if asked, for he meant to go there soon enough.

“There’s word to be weighed,” the Bounder allowed, and looked past them toward the hedge as one listens to a kettle that has not yet begun to sing but will. “There’s been calls on a reed at odd times along the hedge and once by the ferry path: three short, like lads play, but not made like lads play it. Once there came an answer faint and far, as if over water. We did not go to it.”

“Good,” said another voice, courteous and low.

He had been there, close as the gate‑post, and yet neither hobbit had marked his coming. Tall, spare, with a cloak the colour of dust and oak shade, he stood with a certain stillness that made even the quick leaves hold their noise a little. His face was weathered like the posts along the ferry and his eyes were the clear grey that water sometimes has under evening.

“Good,” he said again. “A call not meant for you is not a summons for you.” He bowed a little, as a Ranger will when he wants to put a hobbit at ease. “Peace to the Hay Gate. I am Nathron. My company has the southern watches by courtesy of your folk.”

“And ours by courtesy of yours,” the Bounder said, and bowed in the Shire way: not deep, but warm. “We keep our lanes; you keep the lines beyond; and we pass the word when it is fit to pass.”

“Then let us pass it plain,” Nathron said. “The Greenway is troubled of late: smoke on the downs, travellers robbed near the hollow south of the old hedge‑oak, and a pack of wolves heard on nights when the river breathes east. We have held Sarn Ford since before your grandfathers’ time, but there are more eyes against our fire than there were, and some of them count well.”

“Count?” said Tomberic.

“Crows count,” Nathron answered, half smiling. “And men that make use of them do, too. As for the river: there are signs of testing where the gravel is kind and the shoals lie sly. False cairns set and set again. A ferrystone shifted on another stream not far from here. Knots tied of reed and cord to mark an hour.”

Tolly felt the small weight of twine in his pocket as plainly as if it had tugged there. He did not show it. He looked from the Ranger to the hedge and back, and thought of rules that live in a man even if no one has written them. “If a reed calls,” he said, “and it is not for us, we make no answer. If a light is shown over water, we do not show one back unless it is to warn. If someone we do not know asks the ford by night, we send them by day, with company.”

“Those are good rules,” Nathron said. “Write them down if you keep a book, and give them to the next watch. As for lights: keep your lanterns hooded and near the ground, and never let one hang still in the wind. Those who count from a distance take heart from tidy signals.”

"We have no book," the Bounder admitted, "only memories and a chalk mark on the gate‑post now and again. But a book can be begun as easy as bread, if someone brings the flour." He looked at Tolly as if the flour might be in his pocket beside the twine.

"I have a pencil," Tolly said. "Sometimes I have more sense than that." He smiled, and the men smiled back, and the hedge rustled with a wind that had woken while they stood speaking. He thought of Maralda’s flat board and her red thread and how such rules sit best when a square hand teaches them to walk.

They shared onions and bread and a ladle of stew, and while they ate a small horn sounded far to the south: two low notes, as if the player had no wish to wake anything that might be sleeping between. All the faces turned toward the sound and then toward Nathron. He did not stir except to set his bowl down on the gate‑post.

“Not for us,” he said after a breath. “And too far besides. Yet the wind carries oddly along the riverbeds in this weather. Hear and mark; go and chase not.”

“We can do that,” the Bounder said. “We are hobbits, after all.”

“And we,” said Nathron, “are Rangers. We are too few to chase shadows with our feet when our eyes may do. But I will not lie: you may see more nights like this than you would wish before the year has turned twice.” He looked at the hedge again, not as if expecting an enemy to come out of it, but as one considers the line between two fields: which side wears which crop and how the weather will take them.

“There is a stone at the ford,” he said then, “set by those who knew the river before my father’s father watched it. It keeps faith when the water runs low. We call it the ferrystone. If anyone tells you to move such a stone or marks it with a mark that is not ours, mark that man in your minds instead, and tell us by the next bell.”

“How do we tell you by the next bell?” Tomberic asked. “We’ve no runner faster than a good stew, and the road is long.”

“Leave a token at the willow with the forked crown two fields down the ferry path,” Nathron said. “A split stick bound with two strands only: brown twine if you have it, not bright. Our men pass it at dawn and dusk. Or else go to the old stile by the hollow lane before the Downs and edge the top rail with a notch. We carry the rail’s story in our heads as a smith carries heat in his hand.”

“That is a good way,” Tolly said. “We have no wish to speak more names into the air than a body needs after dark.”

The Ranger inclined his head. “Names have work to do and to rest from. Keep yours where they belong.” He reached into his cloak and drew out a small square of oiled cloth. Inside, folded small, were two scraps of cord: one plain, one a twist of black and green.

“If you see cord such as this,” he said, touching the coloured twist, “do not stir it where it lies. Note it if you can; take a matching piece if there is one loose. But leave the place as quiet as you found it, and tell us. There are buyers to the south who send hands to take what they have not sown. Some have long memories and tidy habits.” He looked at the Bounders then, plain and without scorn. “Your folk have long memories too. Keep them.”

“We will,” the elder Bounder said. “We were given a land to mind, and we mind it.”

The light fell while they spoke, so that the hedge turned black as a ship’s side and the lane grew narrow and friendly. A bat came out and wrote quick words on the air and was gone. Nathron took from the post a small hooded lantern, lit it with a flint, and showed how to shade the light with the hand for a warning without beckoning. Tomberic tried it and made a face when he nearly burned his knuckles; the Bounder laughed out of the side of his mouth and then did the same mistake and laughed at himself.

“That is the way,” Nathron said. “Better to burn a knuckle than to hang a star for men to steer by who have no right to a star. Keep your lamps low, and keep your bells.”

They spoke then of watches and bells and who should sit by night and who by dawn. The Bounders had their own turns and the miller’s boy brought word of who could be spared, and Tolly wrote it neat as he could on a folded paper with his pencil, which scraped like a cricket in the quiet. He did not set down more names than were needed; only what a gate must know to be a gate.

One of the younger Bounders, perhaps to keep his hands steady while he trimmed a wick, sang under his breath, and the others caught the tune lightly without making a show of it:

> We keep to the hedge with our lanterns held low,  
> We listen to water and count as we go;  
> If whistles should call us, we give them no sign,  
> We walk by the bells and we keep to the line.  

When all was said for the evening, Nathron took up his cloak and stood a moment with them at the hedge, not quite in the lane and not quite out of it. “If rumour comes,” he said, “that a grey pilgrim passed along the Greenway this week, pay it respect and let it pass. He has his own errand and we ours, and both run toward the same weather.”

“We have a care for weather,” the Bounder said. “And for guests who go by our doors, whether they knock or only leave good sense behind them.”

“Then we understand one another,” Nathron said. He lifted his hand in farewell, a gesture like brushing away a cobweb, light and clean—and was gone between one breath and the next, with only the small hush that follows a bird’s rise to show where he had stood.

Tolly and Tomberic walked a little way down the lane to where the hedge thinned and you could see, if you stood on a stone, the far gleam of the river under the first stars. The air smelled of cut thorn and cooling earth. Somewhere a horned owl called once and then no more.

“Well?” Tomberic said.

“Well,” Tolly said. “I think I shall go on to Michel Delving tomorrow by the bells, and then south. It isn’t my business to chase shadows. But if there are marks on our stones and knots in our reeds, I would see them with my own eyes, and I would write them down for the day when folk forget what we saw.”

“You will have stew first,” Tomberic said firmly. “And then you can keep faith with stones and reeds. There’s no use keeping faith on an empty stomach.”

“Auntie would say as much and more,” Tolly agreed. He tucked his pencil away, along with the coloured bit of twine, and felt the weight of both not as a burden but as a promise. The hedge breathed like a sleeping thing; the lane held its darkness well. They turned back toward the gate, where the pot still gave off the last of its onion smell, and the Bounders’ talk went on in an easy murmur that meant the night was beginning as it should, with watchfulness and with ordinary things.
