# A Primer for Tolkien‑Adjacent Prose

*Shire‑centric; Third Age 3017; for use by an agent model*

## 0) North‑Star Principles (do not skip)

1. **Sub‑creation over spectacle.** The world feels old because language, names, measures, customs, and songs imply prior ages. Plot events are the tip of an archaeological spear.
2. **Pastoral foreground, epic horizon.** Near field: lanes, hedgerows, kettles, gossip. Far field: barrows, kings, stars older than empires. The tension between them powers the mood.
3. **Moral clarity without didacticism.** Pity, hospitality, and promise‑keeping matter; cruelty and vainglory corrode. No cynicism for its own sake.
4. **Wonder via understatement.** “Magic” is rarely labelled; it emerges through *names*, *songs*, and *things remembered*.
5. **Applicability, not allegory.** Let symbols breathe; avoid one‑to‑one moralizing.

## 1) Narrative Voice

**Stance.** A courteous, learned, occasionally wry omniscient narrator who privileges the local viewpoint but can crane upward to deep time when needed.

**Texture.**

* Uses **parataxis** and **balanced clauses** (“He set down his pack, and the smell of apples rose, and the evening widened.”).
* Allows **authorial asides** sparingly to frame antiquity, calendars, or etymology.
* Employs **free indirect style** for Hobbits: plain idiom, lightly comic common sense.

**Avoid.** Modern filler (“okay,” “sorta”), snark, cinematic jump‑cuts, coarse profanity.

## 2) Register by Situation

| Situation                   | Preferred Register                 | Typical Features                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hearth/market               | Rustic, idiomatic                  | Understatement, proverbs, food‑lexicon, nicknames          |
| Road/hedgerow               | Plain narrative with lyric touches | Weather, birds, distances in miles/leagues, old road‑names |
| Loretelling                 | Elevated but clear                 | Archaism *light* (“ere,” “oft”), kennings, genealogy hints |
| Encounters with the Strange | Measured awe                       | Naming → hush → song fragment → omen                       |

**Rule:** Shift registers *gradually*. A Shire conversation shouldn’t collapse into high epic unless lore intrudes.

---

## 3) Diction & Syntax

**Core vocabulary strata**

* **Anglo‑Saxon/Old‑English flavor** for earthbound things: lane, brook, hedge, byre, wain, coppice, thicket, thatch, smoke, ale, kin, wright.
* **Latinate** for judicious elevation: memory, errand, lineage, valour, errantry.
* **Archaic seasoning** (sparingly): ere, nigh, yonder, whither, hearkened, slumber.
* **Shire coinages** and rusticisms: mathom (odd keepsake), smial (hobbit‑hole), byre, mathom‑house, quickset hedge.

**Syntax markers**

* Tricolons and gentle **alliteration**: “brown, bent, and brittle”; “fern and feather and foam”.
* Moderate **polysyndeton** (“and…and…”) for rolling cadence.
* Occasional **inversion** for elevation: “Strange seemed the light on the ridge.”

**Banned/flagged modernities**

* okay, yeah, stuff, vibe, random, metric units, “percent,” “deadline,” “industry” (unless dwarven context re‑framed).

---

## 4) Song & Verse (agent‑usable schemata)

**Hobbit walking or bath songs**

* **Meter:** Anapestic tetrameter or trimeter.
* **Rhyme:** AABB or ABAB.
* **Mood:** playful, domestic, road‑cheer; rhyme echoes simple objects and food; occasional internal rhyme.
* **Template (schematic, not content):**

  * L1: anapestic tetrameter, ends with a concrete noun.
  * L2: anapestic tetrameter, domestic verb + place‑name.
  * L3–4: trimeter lines that clinch with a rustic proverb or promise.

**Rohirric/old‑style lays (if heard at a distance)**

* **Technique:** Old‑English‑like alliterative half‑lines (avoid heavy academic Sievers jargon; do it by ear).
* **Use sparingly** in a Shire‑centric novella; fragments can drift over downs like weather.

**Elvish lyric** (rare this deep in the Shire; keep to a cameo): longer vowels, internal echoing, star‑words; avoid full conlang unless you can do it cleanly.

**Rule of thumb:** Songs *advance tone* or memory; never pad.

---

## 5) Naming: People, Places, Things (philology‑forward)

**Hobbit personal names**

* **Given names:** Old English or English‑ish: Samwise, Hamfast, Daisy, Ruby, Marigold, Folco, Sancho.
* **Surnames:** Concrete and homely; **compounds** with craft/land: Baggins, Cotton, Proudfoot, Goodchild, Greenhand, Hayward, Brockhouse, Rumble, Heathertoes.
* **Tricks:**

  * Add **-man, -foot, -brook, -burrow, -bottle, -ridge** to root nouns.
  * Use mild phonetic jokes: *Mugwort*, *Puddifoot*.
  * Keep euphony; avoid apostrophe‑ridden fantasy mush.

**Toponyms (Shire & surrounds)**

* **Patterns:** Color + landform (Green Hill Country), craft + place (Michel Delving), water + feature (Bywater), compass + farm (Southfarthing).
* **Productive morphemes:** *By‑, Stock‑, Wood‑, Hay‑, Rush‑, Over‑;* **‑hay, ‑bottle, ‑bridge, ‑gate, ‑worth, ‑delving, ‑combe, ‑holm**.
* **Ranger/Bree‑land spillover:** Chetwood, Greenway, Midgewater; Barliman’s inn culture stays intact.

**Artefacts**

* Names imply age or handcraft: **thain’s seat**, **bounders’ staves**, **tinder‑box of brass**, **mathom‑house ledger**.

**Etymology discipline (for the agent)**

* When you coin, be able to gloss: *Haygate* ← hedge‑gate; *Brockbank* ← badger + field‑ridge.

---

## 6) World & Timeline Anchors (TA 3017)

* **Shire‑Reckoning mapping:** TA 3017 ≈ SR **1417**.
* **Macro events offstage:** The Enemy stirs; **Rangers** intensify quiet watch; **Aragorn** has hunted and taken a certain creature east; **Gandalf** ranges far and is scarce in the Shire. No Black Riders yet on Shire roads.
* **Local feel:** Outward peace; more strangers on the Greenway; dwarves occasionally pass through to the Blue Mountains; weather seasonal, not apocalyptic.
* **Taboos:** No Sharkey’s ruffians (that’s 3019), no Nazgûl chases, no fireworks unless tied to a rare visit long past.

Use these as *constraints*, not exposition dumps.

---

## 7) Geography & Movement

* Distances in **miles** or **leagues**; time by **bells** or sun’s height.
* Roads are named and storied: **Bywater Road**, **Stock Road**, **East Road/Greenway**.
* Describe **edges and thresholds**: gate‑stiles, hedgebanks, the Hay Gate, the Brandywine Bridge, the line where tilled land yields to down or bog.
* Weather is a character: **mists on the Water**, **westering light**, **ground‑frost on furrows**.

---

## 8) Dialogue

**Hobbits**

* Short clauses, idioms, polite understatement, occasional comic hyperbole.
  *“That’s a tidy walk for a Tuesday.”*
  *“No sense hurrying when the lane’s not.”*

**Bree‑folk**

* Plain talk; landlordly hospitality; newsy but not malicious.

**Rangers**

* Courteous, spare; verbs strong, sentences longer; wary of giving true names.

**Elves/Dwarves (if encountered)**

* Elves: musical syntactic parallelism, metaphor by starlight or shore.
* Dwarves: clipped dignity; hard nouns; love of craft‑terms.

**Never** collapse everyone into one voice.

---

## 9) Plot Architecture for a Shire Novella

1. **Quiet opening**: domestic business, a small oddity (a map corner, a handed‑down mathom, an overheard name).
2. **Boundary crossed**: literal hedge, ford, or gate; first road decision and a soft omen (old stone, sudden birds’ silence).
3. **Encounter**: a Ranger, Bree‑man, or Dwarf; exchange of courtesy; a name from far away plants a larger arc.
4. **The Old Things**: barrow, standing stone, or forest fringe; a fragment of verse surfaces; the mood turns solemn but not dire.
5. **Return with addition** (“there and back again,” scaled to a novella): a new proverb, a token, a promise made; hearth re‑entered but perspective widened.
6. **Eucatastrophic note (lightweight at novella scale)**: a narrowly averted harm that reveals a gift—aid from kindness paid earlier.

**Pacing.** Alternation of **road‑cheer** and **lore‑hush**; let meals reset rhythm.

---

## 10) Thematic Load‑bearing Beams

* **Pity is strength.** Sparing a beaten foe, feeding the lost, keeping trust with the dull‑witted.
* **Home rightly loved.** Gardens and kettles aren’t trivial; they are what epics defend.
* **Names remember.** To speak a hill’s old name is to half‑wake it.
* **Small hands move large doors.** Agency without bombast.

---

## 11) Prose Micro‑Patterns (agent checklists)

**Openings**

* Weather + place‑name + concrete action.

  > Example move (original): “Mist lay along the Water, and Tom Hayward propped his hoe against the quickset while the south lane brightened.”

**Transitions**

* Use *road verbs* (trudged, turned, breasted the slope, forded) and *hedge/field geometry*.

**Description**

* Noun clusters first, then a single judicious epithet.
* Soundscaping: lark, rook, distant sheep‑bells, wagon‑rattle.

**Cadence**

* Vary sentence length; end paragraphs on image or proverb, not on abstraction.

---

## 12) Lore‑Insert Discipline

* Insert lore as **occasioned speech** or **found text** (a scrap of letter, a rhyme, a milestone’s worn carving).
* If you must explain, do it in **one poised sentence** followed by **image**.
* Use **appendix‑like footnote tone** rarely and only for calendars/etymology.

---

## 13) Shire Material Culture Cheat‑sheet

* **Food:** ale, small beer, seedcake, pickles, mushrooms, blackberries, bacon, barley bread, cheese, apples.
* **Implements:** hoe, mattock, sickle, churn, tinder‑box, pipe, lantern.
* **Social roles:** bounders (border watchers), shirriff (light policing), the Thain and the Master (as titles, not celebrities).
* **Leisure:** pipes, song, stories; fairs at **Michel Delving**; market talk.
* **Calendar:** talk in seasons and saints‑day‑like fairs, not weekday bureaucracy; “after harvest,” “at first frost,” “by spring sowing.”

---

## 14) What Not to Do (common pastiche failure modes)

1. **Archaic soup.** Thees and thous everywhere; verb endings sprayed indiscriminately.
2. **Thesaurus glamour.** Polysyllables that break the rural music.
3. **Ambient grimdark.** The Shire in 3017 is not war‑torn; dread belongs to rumor and wind, not gore.
4. **Meta‑wisecracks.** No genre‑nudging jokes.
5. **Lore dumps.** If a paragraph reads like a wiki, you’ve broken the spell.
6. **Unanchored magic.** Fireballs and systems; keep enchantment numinous and tied to place, name, or song.

---

## 15) Quick Authenticity Tests (for the agent)

* **Map Test:** Could you draw a map from the prose you just wrote? If not, add road‑names and contours.
* **Hearth Test:** Does a meal or hearth scene *matter* thematically (promise, welcome, mercy)? If it’s garnish, cut it.
* **Name Gloss Test:** For every coined name, can you gloss its meaning and era? If not, revise.
* **Register Drift Test:** Do voices blur? Read one page of dialogue; each speaker should be identifiable by rhythm and lexis.
* **Deep Time Ping:** Once per chapter, a sentence should open a door to an older age—without explaining it.

---

## 16) TA 3017 Scene Seeds (Shire & borders)

Use as prompts; scale to novella:

* A **mathom‑house ledger** misfiles a token from Bree with a half‑rubbed maker’s mark; following it uncovers a forgotten boundary oath.
* A **Ranger** quietly returns a lost family signet at the Hay Gate, asking only for food and no questions.
* **Dwarves** on the Road barter blue slate for pipe‑weed; one verse sung at dusk hints at stone‑kin under the North Moors.
* A **barrow’s shadow** falls long across the Hay; a scrap of verse comes unbidden, leading to a vow kept for someone long dead.
* **Midgewater mists** swallow a path; the adventuring hobbit learns the old name of a stream and earns safe passage.

---

## 17) Compact Style Constraints (drop‑in spec for your agent)

Use the following as a **promptable checklist**:

* **Voice:** Courteous omniscient; free indirect for Hobbit POV; gentle authorial aside 1–2× per chapter.
* **Diction Ratio:** Anglo‑Saxon\:Latinate ≈ **3:1** in Shire scenes; **2:1** when lore rises.
* **Archaism Budget:** ≤ **2** archaic tokens per page (“ere,” “nigh,” “whither”).
* **Cadence:** Sentences 8–28 words; one rolling sentence (35–45 words) per page max.
* **Alliteration:** Aim for **1** mild instance per paragraph; avoid tongue‑twisters.
* **Songs:** ≤ **1** per chapter; hobbit meter by default; must alter tone or memory.
* **Names:** Every new proper noun carries an implied gloss; avoid apostrophes and exotic glyphs in Shire coinages.
* **Geography:** Mention a place‑name or road **every 2–3 pages**; distances in miles/leagues.
* **Theme Tick:** Mercy/hospitality surfaced once per chapter in action, not lecture.

---

## 18) Minimal Example Moves (original, for rhythm only)

* **Hearth opening:**
  *The kettle chattered, and May Rumble lifted it off the hob while the lane outside shook loose the last of the fog. News goes faster than a cart on market‑morn, she said, and set two cups to warming.*

* **Lore hush insertion:**
  *They came to a stone no plough had turned, lichen‑filmed and low; someone once cut a name there, and the wind remembered it though the letters did not.*

* **Ranger encounter cadence:**
  *He asked no questions and answered few, but when he took the cup he bowed as if to older company than theirs, and the room forgot its chatter for a breath.*

These are not templates to ape verbatim; they illustrate cadence and register.

---

## 19) Safety & Canon Edges

* Keep **Nazgûl** off Shire roads in 3017; **Saruman’s hirelings** are not yet meddling locally.
* **Gandalf’s** appearances should be rare, offstage, or reported speech.
* **Cameos** (Bree‑folk, Bounders, distant dwarves) are fine if they serve your novella’s local arc and do not retcon major chronology.

---

## 20) Final admonition (Janus doing his job)

If a paragraph could be transplanted into any generic fantasy and still work, it’s not doing this job. The mark of success is **place‑pressure**: names with gravity, roads that remember feet, speech that smells of pipe‑smoke and hedgerow, and a horizon that sings of older songs without singing them *for* you.

---

### Ready‑to‑use meta‑prompt

> Write original Middle‑earth‑adjacent prose set in the Shire circa SR 1417 (TA 3017). Maintain a courteous omniscient voice with Hobbit free indirect style, pastoral diction (Anglo‑Saxon\:Latinate ≈ 3:1), and gentle alliteration. Keep archaism light (≤2 tokens/page). Anchor scenes with named roads, hedges, bridges, and weather; measure distance in miles or leagues. Introduce one small song per chapter (anapestic, AABB/ABAB) only if it alters tone or memory. Coin names via English morphemes with glossable meanings (e.g., ‑hay, ‑bottle, ‑delving). No overt “magic”; wonder arises through names and remembered verses. Respect 3017 constraints (Rangers vigilant; no Nazgûl in the Shire; Gandalf scarce; no Sharkey). Thematic throughline: pity and hospitality as strength; “there and back again” scaled to a novella. End paragraphs on image or proverb. Avoid modern slang, metrics, and lore dumps.
